UM I'M ABIGAIL CLAFLIN
YOU CAN CALL ME ABBIE
WELCOME EVERYBODY
HERE WE GO
SO THIS IS OUR KICK OFF MEETING
'S SEE
POWERPOINT THAT'S NOT IT
THERE WE GO
UM
AND I GUESS WE SHOULD ALL GET ACQUAINTED
LET'S SHALL WE ALL INTRODUCE OURSELVES
OR WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO JUST SAY MY NAME AND THEN WE CAN TALK ABOUT BUSINESS LATER
UM WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO TALK ABOUT MY AIMS AT THE MOMENT
HI I'M CHIARA I'M THE UM MARKETING EXPERT
I THINK WE'LL GET AROUND TO THAT YEAH
SO THIS IS JUST INTRODUCTIONS YEAH
WE'LL GET ROUND TO THAT LATER
MY NAME IS CHIARA AND I'M THE MARKETING EXPERT
I FORGOT TO S SAY I'M THE PROJECT MANAGER BUT I FIGURED YOU ALL KNEW THAT ALREADY UM SO
OKAY
I'M STEPHANIE AND I AM THE USER INTERFACE DESIGNER
I'M KRISTA AND I'M THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER
OKAY
UM WE'RE GONNA DO SOME TOOL TRAINING PROJECT PLAN AND DISCUSS
UM SO F HERE'S OUR AGENDA FOR TODAY
FUNCTIONAL DESIGN CONCEPTUAL DESIGN AND DETAILED DESIGN
UM SO WE'RE GONNA TRY OUT OUR WHITE BOARD
SO OUR AIM IS TO PRODUCE A REMOTE CONTROL THAT IS ORIGINAL TRENDY AND USER FRIENDLY
RIGHT
THEN CLOSE
AND TO DO THIS WE HAVE TO UM THERE'S CERTAIN THINGS WE HAVE TO CONSIDER ABOUT FUNCTIONAL ASPECTS AND CONCEPTUAL DESIGN OF THE THING
SO
SO THROUGHOUT OUR NEXT COUPLE OF MEETINGS WE'LL WE'LL BE COVERING THESE THINGS
UM SO
WE'LL GET TO THAT
OH THERE IT IS
IF WE'LL ALL DRAW OUR FAVOURITE ANIMAL TO SUM UP THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THAT ANIMAL
SO YOU WANT US TO DRAW IT AND THEN TALK ABOUT IT
OR JUST DRAW IT
OKAY
I THINK BOTH
BOTH
YEAH
YEAH
WHY DON'T WE DO BOTH
OKAY
RIGHT
WHO STARTS
UH-HUH
WE OUGHT TO DECIDE WHO STARTS AND ALL THAT
NO
ANY VOLUNTEERS
DOES ANYONE KNOW WHAT THEY WANNA DRAW
UH
MM I GOTTA THINK ABOUT IT FOR A SECOND LIKE
DOES IT HAVE TO BE FUNCTIONAL TRENDY AND USER FRIENDLY
I DON'T THINK SO
UM
I'LL DRAW ONE
OKAY I'LL DRAW
MAKE SURE MY THINGS HERE
UH OH
RIGHT
OKAY MY FAVOURITE ANIMAL IS SEE
OOPS
'S LIKE PLAYING PICTIONARY
A DOLPHIN
YEAH IT'S
YEAH I GUESS IT HAS A FIN ON TOP TOO YEAH
IT'S MY DOLPHIN
SO WHAT CHARACTERISTICS DO YOU LIKE ABOUT YOUR ANIMAL
THEY'RE SMART AND THEY THEY'RE CUTE AND THEY LIKE SWIMMING AND THAT'S COOL LIKE THEY'RE GRACEFUL YEAH AND THEY'RE SO
I LIKE ITS TAIL
UM NO I THINK DOLPHINS ARE REALLY UH I DUNNO
THEY'RE GRACEFUL
SLEEK
YEAH THEY'RE SLEEK AND THEY LOOK INTELLIGENT AND I DON'T KNOW THEY'RE I GUESS IT'S THE WHOLE LIKE BINOCULAR VISION THING
I DON'T KNOW HOW INTELLIGENT THAT ONE LOOKS
BUT THEY SWIM
YEAH HE HE DOESN'T LOOK THAT SMART
HE'S A I DUNNO UM THEY'RE I THINK IT'S COOL THE THE UM THE INTERACTION THAT OR THE TH THINGS THAT THE REASONS PEOPLE SEEM TO LIKE YOU KNOW YOU GET EX YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE SITTING ON THE BEACH AND P THEY'RE LIKE OH LOOK THERE'S DOLPHINS AND IT'S KINDA LIKE BUT THEY'RE YOU KNOW THEY JUMP AROUND IN THE WATER AND THEY'RE HAPPY AND THEY'RE MAMMALS
YES
DOES ANYBODY ELSE WANNA DRAW THEIR ANIMAL
SUPPOSE I CAN DRAW AN ANIMAL YEAH
UH OH THERE GOES THE TEN
IT'S A CAT
YEAH
I DON'T KNOW
THEY SLEEP ALL DAY THEY'RE EASY TO DRAW
DO YOU WANNA ANYTHING
I DUNNO IF THE THE AH
UH YEAH
WELL I HAD THE CAT AS WELL BUT UH I'VE GOT A SPARE ONE
I THINK THE PEN IS RUNNING OUT OF
SO I'LL USE THE SPARE ONE
UM BUT IT'S HARDER TO DRAW UM
AND THE PEN'S DYING
UM
A HORSE
UH
HORSE
UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW THE LEGS GO BUT ANYWAY I WILL DO THAT
THAT'S VERY GOOD
I THINK THEY'RE VERY PRETTY AND THEY GO WELL WITH THE ENVIRONMENT
UM AND THE MAIN REASON IS THEY'RE PRETTY
AND I LIKE THE WAY THEY RUN AND I USED TO DO HORSE RIDING AND THEY'RE JUST VERY SORT OF STURDY AND NICE ANIMALS
AND I LIKE THE WAY UM THEY FEEL SORT OF UNDER UNDER THE HAND I THINK THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT
UM
YEAH
THIS CORD'S
RIGHT
UH
UH
ACTUALLY I HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF ANYTHING YET
IT'S A PIG
SO I'M THINKING WE SHOULD DESIGN A REMOTE CONTROL THAT'S
WATER RESISTANT STRONG AND FURRY
THIS IS YEAH WELL LIKE A CAT YOU KNOW SOFT YEAH
ALTHOUGH UH I'LL JUST PUT THERE
WHAT DO YOU THINK YEAH
RIGHT
AND FURRY
TEXTILE TACTILE TACTILE REMOTE CONTROL
YOU'RE DRAGGING A YOU HAVE A TAIL
OH MY GOSH THIS IS DISASTROUS
SORRY ABOUT THAT
OUR SELLING PRICE GOAL IS TWENTY FIVE EURO AND PROFIT AIM IS FIFTY MILLION EURO
OKAY
SO I'M GUESSING THAT WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY IN SCOTLAND WE'RE IN SOME EUROPEAN COUNTRY
UM AND WE WILL HOPE TO SELL THIS INTERNATIONALLY
SO MOVING ON
SORRY CAN YOU JUST SAY THAT WHAT'S THE WHAT ARE OUR PRICE GOALS AGAIN
PROFIT AIM FIFTY MILLION EURO
UM SELLING PRICE IS TWENTY FIVE EURO
OKAY
HOW MANY SHOULD WE SELL THEN
UM A LOT TWO TWO TWO MILLION TWO MI NO MORE F FOUR MILLION
ANYONE A MATHEMATICIAN
TWO MILLION
FOUR MILLION
AND IT WELL IT'S THE PROFIT SO IF A PROFIT FOR EACH IS TWELVE FIFTY THAT'LL DO FOUR MILLION
OH YEAH
IT IS A LOT
UH
SO F THAT'S A FIFTY PERCENT UM UH
EXPERIENCE WITH REMOTE CONTROL
UM I DON'T KNOW WHAT THESE MEAN BECAUSE I DIDN'T ACTUALLY MAKE THE SLIDE SHOW
SO I GUESS WE HAVE TO REFLECT ON OUR EXPERIENCES WITH REMOTE CONTROLS TO DECIDE WHAT UM WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE IN A CONVENIENT PRACTICAL
NICE REMOTE CONTROL
UM SO DO WE HAVE ANY INITIAL IDEAS FOR UH HOW THIS REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD BE DESIGNED OR FORMATTED OR THE THE BUTTONS IT SHOULD HAVE
UM I THINK ONE THING IS THAT IT SHOULD BE EASY TO FIND BEC YEAH BEC
I THINK WE SHOULD DESIGN SOMETHING THAT HAS LIKE A SO YOU CAN LIKE SOMEHOW LIKE YOU I MEAN YOU ALWAYS KNOW WHERE YOUR T. V. IS
SO JUST HAVE A CALL BUTTON I'VE ALWAYS WANTED THAT
I WAS THINKING THAT TOO
SO LIKE YOU CAN PUSH A BUTTON ON YOUR T. V. YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH
SO YOU SHOULD HAVE A CALL BUTTON ON YOUR TELEVISION TO BE ABLE TO FIND YOUR REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH
I MEAN YOU HAVE IT FOR THE PORTABLE PHONE SO WHY NOT YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
I DUNNO BUT SOMETH BECAUSE IT'S USUALLY UNDER THE SOFA
AND EVEN I THINK A LITTLE LIGHT
UM OR EVEN A MAYBE A VIB A VIBRATING THING
YEAH
YEAH
IN WHICH CASE YOU'RE GOING TO BE L BUT IF IT HAS A SORT OF SIGNAL WHICH ISN'T ANY SOUND I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S EXPENSIVE MAYBE TO
YEAH
I DON'T YEAH I MEAN IT BUT LIKE I MEAN JUST I MEAN LIKE YOUR PHONE EVEN JUST HAS SO LIKE IT CAN VIBRATE
IT CAN LIGHT UP AND MAKE NOISE AND I DUNNO
MAYBE CALL IS ENOUGH
BUT YEAH
YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH
WHAT IF IT HAD SOMETHING LIKE UM
'CAUSE PEOPLE JUST STICK IT ON TOP OF THEIR T. V. BUT THE POINT OF HAVING A REMOTE IS NOT TO HAVE TO WALK OVER TO THE T. V. SO
YOU KNOW LIKE A PORTABLE PHONE HAS A BASE LIKE JUST TO HAVE A HOME FOR IT
JUST LIKE A MAGNET ON THE BACK OF IT AND YOU COULD I MEAN J JUST TO HAVE SOME PLACE TO PUT IT BESIDES LIKE A BASE
YEAH OR IF IT HAD A YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH I MEAN
WELL THAT'S WHY IT'S ALWAYS IN THE COUCH
YEAH
YEAH
I DUNNO IT SEEMS LIKE THOUGH THAT THAT WOULD BE HARD 'CAUSE YOU NOT YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE LAZY ANYWAY AND
YEAH IN IN THE COUCH
YEAH
MAYBE WE SHOULD DESIGN COUCHES THAT HAVE THE REMOTE CONTROL IN THE SIDE ARM
YEAH SO WE THE PROJECT IS NOW COUCHES AND REMOTE CONTROLS
AND THE OTHER THING IS
BUT IT'S ONLY A PLASTIC THING R REALLY THE THING ON THE WALL
SOMETHING LIKE THAT
BUT THAT WOULD REALLY MAKE IT MORE EXPENSIVE
BUT EVEN JUST A THING TO ATTACH IT TO THE W YOU KNOW IF YOU HAD A THING A PRETTY OBJECT ATTACHED TO THE WALL
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
DO YOU THINK IT NEEDS TO BE BIGGER TO NOT LOSE OR DOES THAT NOT FACTOR IN
BIGGER
NOT WELL IT NEEDS TO BE SORT OF
LIKE
HAND HAND HELD SIZE YEAH
HAND SIZED
I DON'T THINK YOU NEED A
YEAH
NOT NOT HUGE BUT
BUT DEFINITELY NOT WELL I DON'T KNOW
IT CAN'T BE THAT HARD TO PUT SOME KIND OF A NOISE ON IT
NO IT CAN'T BE UH UH
NO IT REALLY WOULDN'T BE
UH
THAT WOULD BE REALLY I'M SURE WE COULD DO THAT FOR TWENTY FIVE EUROS A POP
YOU KNOW
OR MAKE IT MOBILE SO IT RUNS AROUND AND COMES COME FIND YOU YEAH
OR LIKE OR LIKE A LIGHT THING
I DUNNO
YEAH
YEAH
HUH
LIKE SPACESHIP
RIGHT
UM
UM
LITTLE HOMING DEVICE
OKAY
SO WHAT DO WE THINK THIS REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD
FIVE MINUTES
OH DEAR
THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE LEFT
TILL THE MEETING OH RIGHT
'CAUSE I HATE THAT WHEN THEY HAVE TOO MANY BUTTONS AND I MEAN I KNOW IT HAS TO HAVE ENOUGH FUNCTIONS BUT LIKE
SO
I ALSO THINK THOUGH THAT IT SHOULDN'T HAVE TOO MANY BUTTONS
I DON'T KNOW YOU JUST HAVE LIKE EIGHT THOUSAND BUTTONS AND YOU'RE LIKE NO YOU NEVER USE HALF OF THEM
UM OH WE JUST
B. BUTTON AND THE F. BUTTON THEY DON'T DO ANYTHING
YEAH I AGREE
YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH
SO IT HAS LESS BUTTONS BUT IT STILL HAS ALL THE FUNCTIONS
YOU WHAT IF UM MAY BE A LITTLE FANCY BUT WHAT IF IT HAD LIKE A LITTLE SCREEN
LIKE THE WAY A MOBILE PHONE DOES
THAT WOULD BE COOL
YEAH
I MEAN IT JUST SEEMS LIKE YEAH
YEAH
SO YOU COULD LIKE UM LIKE IF YOU HAVE I DUNNO IF YOU HAVE SATELLITE IF YOU HAVE A HUNDRED CHANNELS
SO YOU CAN PROGRAMME LIKE YOUR FAVOURITE CHANNELS SO LIKE IF YOU HAD A S
YOU CAN THE WAY YOU DO IT ON YOUR RADIO IS THAT YOU UH WHAT DO YOU CALL IT S Y YEAH BUT YOU CAN PROGRAMME
UH
SELECT
BUT WOULD YOU HAVE THE SCREEN ON THE THING OR WOULD YOU HAVE IT ON THE TELLY TRANSMITTING THE SCREEN
THAT'S SOMETHING WE COULD DECIDE
MM
I DUNNO
I GUESS THEY WOULD GO TOGETHER SOMEHOW
BECAUSE
THEN YOU CAN PRO SORT OF HAVE A PROGRAMMING FUNCTION
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S I THINK IT'S E EXPENSIVE IF YOU HAVE IF YOU USE THE TELLY SCREEN 'CAUSE THE TELLY'S ALREADY A SCREEN
REALLY EASY SORT OF ARROW UP AND DOWN ON THE REMOTE AND THEN USE THE TELLY AS A SCREEN
YEAH
YEAH
RIGHT
BUT UM
I'M THINKING KIND OF
SOMETHING LIKE NOT IT'S NOT ON THE BUTTON BUT IT'S TELLING YOU WHAT TO DO IS THAT WHAT YOU MEAN
BUT YEAH FOR SURE
YEAH
YEAH
MM
RIGHT
OR LIKE YOU H YOU SEE THOSE YOU KNOW PEOPLE I'M THINKING OF LIKE CELEBRITY CRIBS KIND OF THINGS WHEN LIKE THEY HAVE ALL THOSE THESE THINGS THAT AT THEIR HOUSE YOU KNOW THEIR THEIR ENTIRE HOUSE IS SO ELECTRONIC
AND THEY HAVE LIKE THIS ONE MASTER CONTROL THAT AND IT'S LIKE A HAND HELD LIKE TURNS ON EVERYTHING SORT OF CONTROL AND IT HAS LIKE A SCREEN AND LIKE SO I THINK IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE TO HAVE SOME KIND OF A SCREEN
I DON'T KNOW IF IT MUST BE IT WOULD PROBABLY MUST BE EX TOO EXPENSIVE THOUGH T LIKE I DUNNO
YEAH
BUT LIKE MOBILE PHONES HAVE SCREENS AND THEY'RE CHEAP
MM
YEAH YEAH
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
YEAH
I MEAN WE HAVE TO REMEMBER OUR BUDGET IS TWELVE POINT TWELVE FIFTY FOR TO ACTUALLY MAKE THE DEVICE
YEAH
MM
I MEAN WE'LL HAVE TO SEE HOW MUCH THAT WOULD BE
UM BUT IT'S SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT YEAH
WELL I GUESS WE HAVE TO GET TO THAT LATER YEAH
OR SOME IT I WE CAN FIND OUT PROBABLY ON THE INTERNET HOW MUCH IT'S
YEAH
UM
YEAH AND THE OTHER THING YOU SAID THAT THING ABOUT ROBUST AND WATER UM
WHAT WAS THE WORD
WATER RESISTANT
FURRY
OH I WAS JUST
NO BUT IT'S I THOUGHT AH SPOT ON
GOOD FEEL TACT TACTILE GOOD TACTILE FEEL MAYBE SOMETHING DIDN DOESN'T MAKE YOUR HANDS SWEAT LOT
YEAH
YEAH
MM MM
THAT'S QUITE ANNOYING
MAYBE UM JUST LIKE A SIMPLE THING TO HAVE A CLIP ON IT LIKE SO YOU CAN CLIP IT TO YOUR LIKE THAT'S ANOTHER
YEAH
YEAH CLIP
OOH
UM
UM
UM AND COME UP WITH SOME NEW ONES FOR THE NEXT MEETING WHICH WILL BE IN ANOTHER THIRTY MINUTES
UM
WE SHOULD PROBABLY START WRAPPING UP UM WE'VE GOT SOME INITIAL IDEAS THAT WE CAN ALL LOOK INTO
SO
YEAH
THE
THE
INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER WHAT DOES THAT STAND FOR I. D. YEAH UM IS GOING TO BE LOOKING MORE INTO THE WORKING DESIGN
SO I GUESS YOU'D BE LOOKING AT LOTS OF THE THINGS WE DISCUSSED ABOUT SCREEN AND UM THAT SORT OF THING
YEAH I THINK SO
SOMETHING WHAT IS THE U. I.
USER INTERFACE DESIGNER
YEAH WHAT DOES IT STAND FOR AGAIN
SO THAT'S GONNA BE
USER
THAT'S ME
UH USER INTERFACE DESIGN
I GUESS THAT MAYBE THE WORKING DESIGN HAS ALSO TO DO WITH LIKE THE PHYSICAL FEAT LIKE JUST THE WAY IT LOOKS AND THE WAY IT W
MORE TECHNICAL
SO TECHNICAL FUNCTION
THE WORKING DESIGN IS THE STRUCTURE
YEAH YEAH
WHAT IS TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS EXACTL I I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT
UM I GUESS YOU'D HAVE TO FIND OUT
IT SAYS ON THAT EMAIL BUT IT
UM
IT WAS IN THE EMAIL
I WROTE DOWN WHAT MINE WERE
IT DOES BUT IT I JUST DON'T REALLY
IT SAID UM
YEAH
IT SAID
AND WORKING DESIGN
WHAT EFFECT SHOULD THE THING HA SHOULD IT HAVE OKAY
ALRIGHT
OKAY
YEAH LIKE
BE A MEDIUM BETWEEN YOU AND THE TELLY I THINK THAT'S UH
AND HOW IT WORKS OKAY
I'M I'M ON TASK
YEAH YEAH
ALRIGHT
RIGHT
MM
M
AND THE M. E. WHAT DOES THAT STAND FOR
MARKETING
UM
MARKETING RIGHT
OH IT'S WRITTEN HERE BUT UM
MARKETING
SO WE'LL BE WORKING ON THE USER REQUIREMENTS UM
YEAH
I'LL SEE YOU ALL IN THIRTY MINUTES
SO I GUESS THAT WRAPS IT UP
OKAY
I JUST DID
OKAY
UM I I'LL GET THE ONES UP FOR NEXT TIME UM THEY'RE NOT FINISHED YET
'KAY SO WE'LL TRY TO ZIP THROUGH THIS SINCE WE'RE SHORT ON TIME
UM SO THIS IS OUR FUNCTIONAL DESIGN MEETING WE'RE GOING TO CONSIDER UM USER NEEDS TECHNICAL EFFECTS AND THE WORKING DESIGN OF OUR REMOTE CONTROL
UM I'VE BEEN TAKING MEETINGS ON THE MINUTE MINUTES ON THE MEETINGS
RIGHT
UM SO CAN WE HAVE UPDATES FROM EVERYONE FROM WHAT YOU'VE WORKED ON JUST KIND OF A QUICK SUMMARY OF ANYTHING INTERESTING THAT YOU'D LIKE TO SHARE OR DISCUSS IN THIS SURE
WELCOME EVERYBODY
AND I'LL BE PUTTING THEM IN THE SHARED DOCUMENTS FOLDER SO IF THERE'S ANYTHING YOU NEED TO REFER TO YOU CAN FIND THEM IN THERE
UM HOPE YOUR SESSIONS WENT WELL
AND I CAN START IF YOU WANT
MM
NO
WE HAVEN'T DECIDED ON AN ORDER
IS THERE AN ORDER
HM
YEAH
NO ANY ANY ORDER'S FINE
FIRST
OKAY
UM HOW DO I PUT THIS I'LL JUST PUT THE CABLE IN
JUST UH
OH YEAH SORRY
OH HERE
IS THAT IT
CAN YOU SEE
OKAY
SO WHAT HAPPENS IT DOESN'T WORK
IT SH IT TAKES A FEW SECONDS I THINK
YOU MAY NEED TO
WHO'S THAT
NO
IS IT IN THE RIGHT THING
BUT SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO DO IT IT'S LIKE A THREE SET SETTING CYCLE SO PRESS IT A COUPLE TIMES HOLD DOWN FUNCTION AND THEN PRESS F. EIGHT
OH WAIT UM
YOU NEED TO HELP ME
UH
UH-HUH AND THEN PRESS FUNCTION
YEAH
AND F. EIGHT
COULD YOU JUST PLUG IT BACK INTO HERS BECAUSE SHE HAD OH
THAT'S IS THAT IT
OH WAIT
ADJUSTING
HERE WE ARE
THE CABLE MIGHT BE A LITTLE LOOSE OR SOMETHING
OH YOU GOT IT
RIGHT HERE WE ARE
IN ORDER TO SEE WHAT THE FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS WERE TO BE FOUND UM
WE'RE HERE
OKAY UM
IS IT ON
OH
OKAY
A HUNDRED PEOPLE WERE TESTED IN A USABILITY LABORATORY THROUGH JUST THEIR HABITS TO N KNOW THEIR HABITS WERE OBSERVED AND QUESTIONNAIRES WERE GIVEN OUT
I DON'T KNOW WHAT R. S. I. MEANS
UM THE FINDINGS IN IN SOME CASES MATCHED WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT
CUSTOME CUSTOMERS AND USERS DON'T LIKE THE WAY REMOTE CONTROLS LOOK THEY DON'T LIKE THE WAY THEY FEEL THEY DON'T THINK THEY MATCH THEIR OPERATING BEHAVIOUR
SO LATER ON THERE'S A STUDY OF THE BUTTONS THAT THEY USE MOST AND I THINK WE SHOULD DESIGN ACCORDING TO THESE BUTTONS
EASY TO LOSE AND R. S. I.
UM THE PERSON THAT DID THE QUESTIONNAIRE OBVIOUSLY DID I DON'T HAVE A CLUE
AND AN EXAMPLE IS WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE BUTTONS THEY ONLY USE TEN PER CENT OF THE BUTTONS
HM
THEY'RE USED ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIXTY TIMES PER HOUR
SO THE MOST IMPORTANT BUTTONS ARE THOSE TO DO WITH CHANNEL SELECTION
I HAVE MADE A LIST OF THE BUTTONS THAT WE SHOULD FOCUS ON IN ORDER OF IMPORTANCE
UM ACCORDING TO THE FREQUENCY OF USE AND THE RELEVANCE OF EACH BUTTONS
AND UM
YEAH SO AND AND PEOPLE LIKE TO ZAP A LOT APPARENTLY SO THIS IS THE ORDER
CHANNEL SELECTION TELETEXT VOLUME AND POWER
THE OTHER ONES ARE THE SETTINGS AND THEY'RE USED LESS THAN YOU KNOW ZERO POINT EIGHT TO ZERO POINT FIVE TIMES PER HOUR
AND THIS MEANS THAT I THINK WE CAN WE COULD HAVE LIKE A A BUTTON FOR ALL THE SETTINGS AND THEN JUST ONE
AND THEN FROM THERE GO ON TO THE AUDIO ON THE SCREEN EITHER ON THE REMOTE OR ON THE TELEVISION
UM
SO PEOPLE THAT ARE SIXTY FIVE FOR EXAMPLE WOULDN'T ACTUALLY PAY FOR THIS SORT OF THING
ABOUT THE SCREEN AND SPEECH RECOGNITION SOME PEOPLE ARE MORE WILLING THAN OTHERS TO ACTUALLY PAY FOR THAT
BUT I THINK THAT THE PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY DO BUY REMOTES M MORE ARE THOSE LIKE TEENAGERS AND YOUNG PROFESSIONALS AND UM
WHILE PEOPLE THAT ARE ABOVE THIRTY FIVE YEARS OL UM YEARS OLD GO FROM THIRTY FIVE PERCENT TO EIGHT PERCENT
UM I DON'T I DON'T KNOW UM WHAT THE DECISION TO BE MADE IS
MOST LIKELY BUT WE SHOULD DISCUSS THIS TOGETHER
AND IF WE LOOK AT THE MARKET F PEOPLE FROM WELL FROM FIFTEEN TO THIRTY FIVE YEAR OLD YEAR OLDS I DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW TO DESCRIBE THIS
UM NINETY ONE TO SEVENTY SIX PERCENT OF PEOPLE IN THAT AGE RANGE ARE WILLING TO PAY MORE FOR THIS SORT OF PRODUCT
AND THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THE MATTER UM
'KAY
SHALL I WHAT DO I DO
DO I GIVE THIS TO SOMEONE ELSE
JUST MOVE RIGHT ON
YEAH
RIGHT
SO GET THIS
OKAY SO NOW I NEED TO PRESS F. EIGHT WHAT IS IT
UH FUNCTION F. EIGHT
FUNCTION F. EIGHT
WHAT'S FUNCTION
'KAY
IT'S THE LITTLE BLUE W IT'S THE ONE TH YEAH
OH FUNCTION I SEE IT
THERE WE GO
YEAH SHOULD BE
IT SHOULD BE YEAH
UM
OKAY
THIS MY PRESENTATION ABOUT THE UH TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS DESIGN AND I BASICALLY JUST TRIED TO FOCUS ON UM
JUST WHAT WHAT FUNCTIONS WE NEED AND HOW TO MAKE THAT
THE BEST FUNCTION FOR THE USER
UM SO I THINK THINGS LIKE UH
SO UH AND I JUST SORT OF LIKE THOUGHT ABOUT IT MYSELF AND LOOKED ON THE INTERNET
AND OKAY SO BASICALLY UM I THINK I UH LIKE IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE SORT OF GET THIS DONE IN A USER FRIENDLY AND FASHIONABLE WAY
YOU KNOW KEEPING BUTTONS TOGETHER THAT LIKE CLOSE TOGETHER THAT UM ARE USED IN THE SAME WAY UH OR UM MAYBE THAT MAKING 'EM THE SAME COLOUR
AND ALSO THINGS LIKE IS IT IS IT UM IS IT UH CAN YOU C Y SMALL ENOUGH LARGE ENOUGH I'M NOT SURE WE C I GUESS WE WOULD NEED TO
KEEPING THE NUMBER OF BUTTONS THE UH LEAS YOU KNOW TO A MINIMUM
AND UM
DOES IT HAVE LIKE CAPACITY TO CHANGE THE CHANNELS
UM BUT BASICALLY WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT IT TURNS ON AND OFF THE T. V.
AND THEN IS IT FINDABLE AND UH HOW DO WE WANNA DO THAT
DO SOME RESEARCH ABOUT I WOULD ABOUT WHAT SIZE IS APPROPRIATE AND THAT SORT OF THING
UM DOES IT DO OR DO WE NEED TO HAVE LIKE FUNCTIONS FOR CABLE OR V. C. R.
I JUST THOUGHT THAT THESE TWO REMOTES WERE PRETTY BORING UM I DUNNO IF THIS WILL WORK BUT
AND I THINK WE CAN FIND SOMETHING THAT'S MORE FUN TO LOOK AT AND USE THAN EITHER OF THOSE
UH BUT I MEAN I THINK WE SH CAN SORT OF THINK ABOUT THINGS LIKE UM LIKE COLOUR AND YOU KNOW SIZE
SHAPES THAT SORT OF THING TO BEST FIT THE USER
JUST I MEAN I LIKE THE ONE ON THE RIGHT BETTER JUST BECAUSE IT DOES HAVE FEWER BUTTONS
THAT CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION
OKAY
YOU NEED THE LITTLE THINGY
OOH
HOW DO I UM
S
OH
THAT'S ON VIEW
RIGHT
OKAY SO THIS IS ON THE WORKING DESIGN WHICH IS SORT OF THE UH MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS OF THE REMOTE
UM AND THE METHOD I USED WAS TO BASICALLY LOOK AT EXISTING DESIGNS AND INCORPORATE IDEAS FROM OUR LAST MEETING
UM SO I THINK WE NEED TWO BASIC FUNCTIONS WHICH IS JUST THE BASIC REMOTE FUNCTIONS
THE USER CAN INPUT A CHANNEL OR VOLUME SETTING AND IT WILL BE OUTPUT TO THE T. V.
AND ALSO WE TALKED ABOUT UM A LOCATION FUNCTION WHERE MAYBE YOU COULD PRESS A BUTTON ON THE T. V. AND IT WOULD SEND SORT OF SIGNAL TO THE REMOTE WHERE IT WOULD BEEP OR FLASH OR VIBRATE OR WHATEVER TO TELL YOU WHERE THE REMOTE IS
LIKE POSSIBLY A BEEP OR A VIBRATION
SO THE COMPONENTS WE NEED ARE AN ENERGY SOURCE TO POWER THE REMOTE UM INPUT WHICH WOULD PROBABLY BE BUTTONS
UM SOMETHING TO TRANSMIT IT TO THE T. V. AND WE ALSO NEED SOMETHING ON THE REMOTE THAT WOULD RECEIVE THE LOCATION SIGNAL AND HAVE AN OUTPUT
WHICH WOULD PROBABLY BE A SEPARATE UM THING THAT WE'D HAVE TO SELL WITH THE REMOTE AND PEOPLE COULD STICK IT ON THEIR T. V. OR STICK IT ON THEIR WALL
AND ALSO YOU NEED A SENDER FOR LOCATION SIGNAL
ALTHOUGH UM WE JUST TALKED ABOUT VOICE RECOGNITION PROCESSOR TO TAKE THE INFORMATION
AND THIS IS JUST SORT OF AN OVERVIEW OF HOW THE REMOTE WORKS
POWER COMES FROM THE BATTERY GOES TO THE CHIP
UM WE COULD USE I. R. BUT WE'D PROBABLY WANNA USE RADIO INSTEAD
UM AND THEN IT IS SENT FROM THERE TO AN INFRARED BULB WHICH IS PROBABLY THE EASIEST WAY TO SEND TO THE T. V.
AND THEN FOR THE LOCATION FUNCTION YOU WOULD HAVE A SENDER ON THE T. V. WHICH WOULD OUTPUT SOME SORT OF SIGNAL
THAT SIGNAL WOULD GO TO A RECEIVER WHICH IT WOULD PROCESS IT AND IT WOULD BE OUTPUT IN THE FORM OF A BUZZER OR A LIGHT LIGHTING UP
UM WE CAN PURCHASE A PRE MADE CHIP WHICH WILL HANDLE ALL THE PROCESSING STUFF I. R. TRANSMITTER TO COMMUNICATE TO THE T. V.
THAT'S JUST SORT OF STANDARD UM SO MOST T. V. S HAVE AN I. R. RECEIVER
UM SO MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES FOR HOW TO BUILD THE REMOTE WOULD PROBABLY BE UH BATTERY FOR THE ENERGY SOURCE
PROBABLY A RADIO RECEIVER TO SEND OUT LOCATION FUNCTION AND TO RECEIVE IT AND I'D PROBABLY SAY A BUZZER FOR THE LOCATION FUNCTION ON THE REMOTE ITSELF
SO THAT CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION
THAT WAY YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO PLUG IT IN UM A BUTTON PAD FOR INPUT
'KAY
DO YOU KNOW ABOUT LIKE I DUNNO YOU SEEM LIKE YOU KNOW ABOUT
MM
YEAH UH I D I WAS AN ENGINEER BEFORE I CAME HERE
OKAY
COOL
UM WE HAVE WE'LL DISCUSS THAT AND THEN I JUST WANNA MENTION SOME NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENTS THAT CAME IN
OKAY
WELL THANK YOU EVERYBODY
UM
UM TELETEXT IS APPARENTLY OUTDATED SO DUE TO INTERNET POPULARITY SO THAT'S OFF THE LIST
UM AND ALSO WE NEED TO INCORPORATE OUR CORPORATE IMAGE ONTO THIS SO UM THE
ALSO OUR REMOTE SHOULD BE USED ONLY FOR TELEVISION UM NO EXTRA INTERNET KINDA FANCY THINGS JUST THE REMOTE AND THE TELEVISION
SO IF WE HAD A LIKE A KIND OF SILVER ONE LIKE YOU SAW AND YELLOW WRITING SOMETHING LIKE THAT
OKAY
UM IF WE HAVE SOMETHING I MEAN SILVER AND AND GOLD OR YELLOW ARE OUR COLOURS
UM
PHRASE IS WE PUT FASHION IN ELECTRONICS SO LET'S BE FASHIONABLE I GUESS
SO WE NEED TO MAKE SOME DECISIONS ON THE REMOTE CONTROL FUNCTIONS
UM
DO LET'S I GUESS WE SHOULD YEAH MAKE SOME
YEAH
KIND OF BRAINSTORMING SEE WHAT WE CAN
LIKE IN TERMS OF
HOW IT LOOKS OR
HOW IT LOOKS OR LIKE WHAT IT DOES
WHA WHAT UM WELL PROBABLY OUR TARGET GROUP AND HOW IT'S GONNA GOING TO APPEAL TO OUR TARGET GROUP AND I DUNNO THE THE S THE BUTTONS AND WHAT IT DOES AND THAT SORT OF THING
SO
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH
SO
IS OUR TARGET GROUP THEN PEOPLE SO DO WE WANNA GO AHEAD AND DESIGN THIS THING WITH THE FINDER BUTTON
SO
I THINK THAT SEEMS TO YEAH
MM
IT'S EASY TO IMPLEMENT
OKAY
SO THEN OUR TARGET AGE GROUP WOULD BE THE NINETEEN TO THIRTY FIVE RANGE WHAT WAS IT
SO THE YEAH YEAH YEAH
THE THE BUZZER YOU MEAN YEAH FOR SURE YEAH
LOCATOR
YEAH TEENAGERS AND YOUNG PROFESSIONALS
WELL THAT'S FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION
OH
WELL
OH UH
THAT'S ONLY FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION AND SCREEN
AND SCREEN
OR IT SEEMS LIKE A SILLY I'M NOT SURE HOW YOU WOULD IMPLEMENT IT
AND IF SOMEBODY SAYS LIKE ONE THEN THE T. V. 'S GONNA SWITCH ITSELF TO CHANNEL ONE
AND ALSO IF THE T. V. IS ON IT'S MAKING SOUND AND THE PEOPLE ON THE T. V. ARE TALKING
I WAS THINKING ABOUT THAT BUT UH I MEAN SPEECH RECOGNITION IS REALLY HARD TO PROGRAMME
YEAH
I MEAN
YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
MM
BUT UM THE SCREEN IS THE SAME AS WHAT
I JUST PUT THE VALUES IN
TO H HAVE SPEECH RECOGNITION PROGRAMMED IN EVERY SINGLE REMOTE MIGHT BE A LITTLE PRICEY
YEAH
RIGHT SO UM YEAH
AND IF IF YOU CONSIDER OUR BUDGET IT PROBABLY IF YOU CONSIDER OUR BUDGET
IT'S A COOL IDEA BUT
YEAH
YEAH I'M HAPPY WITH THAT
COMPLETELY
HU YEAH
OKAY SO ARE WE GONNA HAVE JUST SOME KIND OF A LIKE WE'LL HAVE THE BUZZER ON THE SOM LIKE ON THE T. V. ITSELF
WELL YOU WOULD HAVE TO HAVE A BUTTON ON A T. V. OR ON YOUR WALL OR SOME PLACE SINCE THE T. V. ALREADY HAS POWER
UM SO PROBABLY LIKE A RADIO SIGNAL LIKE ON A ON A CELL PHONE
YEAH YOU CLICK THE BUTTON IT'S GONNA SEND OUT A SIGNAL AND I WAS THINKING I. R. IS LINE OF SIGHT
SENDS OUT A SIGNAL AND THEN THE THE REMOTE HEARS THE SIGNAL AND SO IT BEEPS PROBABLY
SO UNLESS THE REMOTE IS LIKE ACTUALLY IN FRONT OF THE T. V. IT'S NOT GONNA WORK
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
ALRIGHT
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
SO YOU YOU'D NEED LIKE A SEPARATE BASE FOR THAT OR LIKE SOMETHING YOU CAN RIGHT
IT WOULD HAVE TO BE SOLD SEPARATELY BECAUSE IF THE SENDER'S ON THE REMOTE THEN YOU'D HAVE TO FIND THE REMOTE FIRST TO CLICK THE BUTTON TO FIND THE REMOTE
YEAH YEAH
SO DO YOU PLUG IT IN THE T. YOU PLUG IT IN T. V. THIS THING
YEAH IT'D PROBABLY JUST STICK IT ON YOUR T. V. SO IF YOU NEED TO FIND THE REMOTE CLICK THE BUTTON
OKAY
OKAY
ALRIGHT
OKAY
SO IT'S NOW LIKE A TWO PART THING
YEAH SO IT WOULD BE A TWO PART PACKAGE
OKAY
SO WE GET TO DESIGN THAT TOO
MAKE IT FASHIONABLE
UM OKAY
SO DO YOU THINK EVEN THOUGH WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT SPEEK SPEECH RECOGNITION OUR TARGET GROUP SHOULD STILL BE TEENAGERS AND YOUNG PROFESSIONALS
HUH
YEAH I THINK SO
YEAH
JUST THERE
OKAY
MM
DO YOU STILL WANT TO BUILD A LITTLE THING NEXT TO THE TELLY OR TO P HANG ON THE WALL OR SHALL WE LEAVE THAT FOR NOW
ARE WE UM SHOULD THAT THING BE ON THE THING TO PUT THE YOU S YOU TALKING ABOUT A HOME FOR IT
YEAH
WE PROBABLY LEAVE THAT
I MEAN I GUESS ONE TAKES CARE OF THE OTHER LIKE UM IF YOU CAN YEAH IF YOU CAN CALL IT THEN IT'S
OKAY
YEAH
THEN IT CAN LIVE ANYWHERE
YEAH
FOR THE SO YOU HAVE THAT BUTTON THAT SO THERE'S IS THERE A LIGHT OR SHALL WE LEAVE JUST HAVE A RADIO
OKAY
YEAH
UM ON THE T. V. OR ON THE PHONE
I MEAN WHEN YOU NEED TO FIND YOUR PHONE
YOU JUST HAVE SOMEONE CALL IT AND IT STARTS RINGING SOMEWHERE AND THEN YOU CAN FIGURE OUT THAT IT'S IN THE COUCH OR WHEREVER
UM IT SEEMED LIKE A A BEEP SEEMED THE MOST REASONABLE TO ME I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE PHONE HAS
ARE WE JUST HAVING A RADIO
ON THE PHONE
T
YEAH YEAH YEAH
YOU DON'T NEED A LIGHT
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
AND LIKE IF THE IF THE PHONE'S UNDER THE COUCH YOU MIGHT NOT SEE THE LIGHT SO YEAH
UM
YOU CAN HEAR IT'S UNDER THE COUCH YEAH
SO I YEAH
SO NEED THE OTHER BUTTONS
SO WE HAVE THIS MM
SO I MEAN THE TWO REMOTES THAT YOU HAD SHOWN R I DON'T REMEMBER WHO SHOWED THEM YEAH YOU YOU DID UM
THEY'RE I MEAN ONE LOOKED LIKE IT WAS FOR V. C. R. TYPE THING AND THE OTHER LOOKED LIKE JUST TELEVISION
MM-HMM
THAT WAS THAT WAS ME
AND UH
I THINK W I THINK THEY'RE BOTH SORT OF JUST LIKE GENERAL REMO THEY'RE BOTH GENERAL REMOTES
OH REALLY
'CAUSE THAT THAT IS SOMETHING WE HAVE TO DECIDE IS WHETHER WE WANT TO HAVE V. C. R. CAPABILITIES
YEAH
DOES ANYONE KNOW IF V. C. R. S ARE THE SAME ACROSS INTERNATIONAL
THEY'RE NOT NO
THEY'RE NOT NO
OKAY SO YOU'D NEED LIKE A WHOLE DIFFERENT SET OF BUTTONS FOR EVERYBODY'S V. C. R. S
S
BUT D. V. D. PROBABLY IS
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT YEAH
IT NOT V. H. S. HERE
YEAH OTHER THAN THAT REGION AND CODING THING
UM
BUT V. C. R. S
AND AND IF WE'RE IF WE'RE TARGETING YOUNG PROFESSIONALS AND TEENAGERS I MEAN IT'S GONNA BE D. V. D. TYPE THAT'S THE THE TECHNOLOGY THESE DAYS
YEAH FOR SURE
YEAH
YEAH
SO
OKAY LET'S SEE IF I CAN I THINK STILL THOUGH IT SHOULDN'T BE THAT HARD TO TAKE LIKE JUST REDUCE THE NUMBER OF BUTTONS YOU KNOW
LIKE 'CAUSE IF YOU JUST HAVE LIKE ONE MENU BUTTON THAT WORKS LIKE WITH A
MM-HMM
YEAH
YOU KNOW OR YOU CAN JUST KIND OF SCROLL THROUGH THE OPTIONS U THAT COME UP ON THE T. V.
YEAH
WELL FOR SURE WE NEED THE UM I THINK WE CAN JUST DESIGN THE
CHANNELS
I MEAN POWER'S JUST A BUTTON AND IT'S NOT USED THAT MUCH
S AND IT'S USUALLY THAT RED AND I THINK IT'S QUITE NICE TO KEEP IT LIKE RED
S
YEAH
MM-HMM
HUH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
LIKE IF YOU HOLD ONE DOWN IT'S IT'S A DIFFERENT COLOUR THAN THE OTHER BUTTONS BUT THAT TURNS IT ON
SO YOU DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE A SEPARATE POWER BUTTON IT'S JUST
YOU KNOW I'VE SEEN SOME REMOTES THAT WHERE YOU JUST HOLD ONE
OH OKAY YEAH
IT SEEMS LIKE THAT WOULD BE HARD THOUGH
JUST 'CAUSE I WOULDN'T I WOULD PROBABLY PICK IT UP AND JUST BE LIKE UH WHY IS THERE NO ON BUTTON
B YEAH
YEAH
I MEAN LIKE BECAUSE UNLESS YOU KNOW YEAH
BUT
YEAH
IT MIGHT BE CONFUSING
YEAH
BESIDES YOU LIKE TO BE ABLE TO GO POWER
SO WE DEFINITELY WANT A POWER BUTTON AND NUMBERS
RIGHT
I HAVE THE POWER I GUESS
YEAH I NEVER THINK TO HOLD SOMETHING DOWN
YEAH
YEAH
WELL EVEN UM IPOD THING LIKE UM I DON'T KNOW IF PEOPLE LIKE THIS BUT IF YOU WANT TO REDUCE THE NUMBER
OF BUTTONS INSTEAD OF HAVING LIKE ONE TO NINE HAVE A SORT OF
THAT SORT OF LIKE JOYSTICK FLAT TOUCH THING YEAH
YEAH
BECAUSE PEOPLE LI SEEM NOW THE IPOD'S OUT PEOPLE SEEM TO LIKE THIS THING THAT THERE'S NO
SCROLLING I DON'T KNOW
MM
KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE
YEAH YEAH
I THINK THAT'S AN INTERESTING IDEA 'CAUSE IT'S COOL
IT'S IT'S FUNNY LIKE YOU F LIKE I JUST I DON'T HAVE AN IPOD BUT LIKE I YOU KNOW
AND YOU JUST SORT OF AND IT'S FUNNY HOW YOU PICK IT UP AND YOU JUST FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE IT QUITE EASILY
LIKE IT'S NOT THAT HARD YOU KNOW
I JUST LIKE STARTED MESSING AROUND WITH ONE OF MY FRIEND'S THE OTHER DAY
MM
YEAH
YEAH YEAH IT'S JUST AND IT'S ONE THING WHICH HAS EVERYTHING
IT IS REALLY BUT DO YOU NEED A SCREEN THEN DO YOU HAVE TO HAVE A SCREEN THEN
YEAH AND IT IS YEAH
WELL CAN'T IT TELL THE LIKE CAN'T YOU IF YOU YOU CAN HAVE THE NUMBER ON THE TELLY GOING LIKE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE ONCE YOU SCROLL AND THEN
YEAH YOU CAN HAVE THE NUMBER GOING AROUND IN THE CORNER
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
OKAY SO WE HAVE THIS LIKE SCROLLING SORT OF BUTTON
YEAH
OH THAT'S GONNA
IS THAT LIKE ON ON A MOUSE PAD WHERE LIKE KIND OF OKAY
LIKE A DISC
YEAH
IT'S LIKE IT'S JUST LIKE THE SAME TECHNOLOGY AS A MOUSE PAD
YEAH
NO
I'VE NEVER USED ONE
IT'S LIKE L THIS LIKE THAT AND THEN YOU DO THAT
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH AND THEN
AND THEN YOU CAN HAVE UM IF YOU ACTUALLY JUST WANT TO ZAP YOU CAN HAVE LIKE A THING
LIKE THAT AND THAT AND THEN IT CAN JUST BE PLUS AND MINUS
OKAY
SO LIKE IT'S LIKE A LITTLE PART OF THE CIRCLE THAT
OR IT OH SO IT'S JUST A REGION OF THE CIRCLE THAT YOU CAN
YEAH YOU CAN
WELL I
YEAH CLICK O ACTUALLY CLICK ON TO HAVE
OKAY
ZAP
YOU COULD HAVE THE VOLUME AND THE CHANNEL CHANGERS JUST LIKE ON THAT AS WELL
WE COULD WE COULD EVEN HAVE FOUR BUTTONS LIKE IF THAT'S THE IF THAT'S THE MOUSE
YEAH
SO VOLUME COULD BE LIKE THE TOP IT AND THE BOTTOM SO DO YOU NEED TO OKAY
YEAH
DOESN'T IT ROTATE THOUGH SO IT'LL BE MOVING AROUND
WELL Y YOU HAVE TO YOU HAVE TO LIKE BE ABLE TO CHANGE THE FUNCTION OF IT TO LIKE
WHAT DO YOU MEAN THE FUNCTION
I MEAN LIKE OKAY 'CAUSE SO
THAT THAT MEANS YOU'RE GONNA GO UP THE CHANNELS AND THEN YOU SCROLL THE OTHER WAY AND IT'LL GO DOWN
I DUNNO I GUESS OKAY SO WHEN YOU G SCROLL YOUR THUMB LIKE AROUND IT IT'LL S LIKE SAY YOU'RE GO YOU'RE GOING CLOCKWISE
BUT THEN SO IF YOU WANNA SWITCH TO THE TO U DO YOU HAVE TO SWITCH TO A FUNCTION WHERE
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
THAT'S THAT WAY AND VOLUME IS UP AND DOWN
LIKE Y SO YOU'RE EITHER IN THAT MODE OR YOU'RE IN THE MODE WHERE LIKE IT JUST HAS LIKE THE FOUR LIKE YOU KNOW THIS IS CHANNEL THAT WAY
THE IPOD KNOWS
YEAH BUT IT KNOWS FOR SOME REASON
IT JUST
S
IT JUST KNO THE IPOD KNOWS
IF IT WORKS ON AN IPOD THEN IT WORKS
SO YOU JUST YOU JUST CAN EITHER DO THIS OR LIKE YOU CAN JUST TOUCH IT IF YOU WANT
YEAH
HUH
I DON'T HAVE ONE
WELL FOR THE VOLUME YOU HAVE TO PRESS THE MIDDLE AND THEN GO UP
THAT'S WHAT I MEAN
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY SO YOU HAVE TO LIKE PRESS THIS MIDDLE REGION AND THEN YOU CAN SCROLL UP GO UP AND DOWN
OH
AND THEN WELL IF YOU DO THAT IT GOES
BUT IF YOU LIKE THAT MAKES MORE SENSE 'CAUSE THERE'S ALREADY ONES WITH UP AND DOWN HERE THAT I'VE SEEN
SO IT'S LIKE HOLDING
YOU CAN O
AND YOU
LIKE
OR ARE YOU ACTUALLY YOU'RE JUST USING THE MOUSE TO GO UP AND DOWN
YOU IS THERE AN EXTRA ACTUAL BUTTON
WELL WHAT YOU FOR THE IPOD YOU PRESS AN W RIGHT IF YOU'RE ON THE CHANNEL LET'S SAY
THEN YOU PRESS ON THE MIDDLE AND THEN IF YOU DO THAT AGAIN THE VOLUME GOES UP AND IF YOU DO THAT IT GOES DOWN
BUT IF YOU WANNA KEEP IT WITH VOLUME HERE AND HERE I'M PRETTY SURE
IT'S LIKE A B
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
RIGHT
MM-HMM
WELL I MEAN IF IF YOU'RE GONNA THIS FOR CHANNELS RIGHT THEN Y WOULDN'T THE VOLUME NEED TO BE SEPARATE SOMEHOW
LIKE YOU COULD JUST HAVE
YEAH
I DON'T KNOW YOU COULD CLICK AND THEN HAVE IT UP AND DOWN BUT I THINK
OH LIKE
LIKE
OH YOU COULD ACTUALLY
YOU DON'T THINK SO
BUT THE ONLY THING IS LIKE IPODS ARE SO EXPENSIVE LIKE IT HAS TO BE IS THAT PART OF YEAH I DUNNO I DUNNO
I THINK WE CAN GO ON THE FACT THAT IT DOES JUST WORK WITH THE IPOD
OKAY
YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
IS THAT WHAT MAKES THEM EXPENSI I THINK IT'S ALL OF THEY HAVE SO MUCH MEMORY THOUGH THAT'S IT'S
I DON'T THINK SO
I DON'T THINK IT'S THE WHEEL DEALY
I THINK IT
I THINK IT'S THE UH H IT'S THEIR CAPABILI I MEAN THEY IT CAN HOLD WHAT LIKE FIVE THOUSAND SONGS OR SOMETHING
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
I'M THINKING WE COULD IF IF WE'RE HAV SO BA I MEAN BUT AN IPOD JUST HAS THAT CIRCLE THING YOU KNOW
YEAH
AND THEY'RE RE PROGRAMMABLE AREN'T THEY
YOU CAN PUT ON YOUR SONGS AND THEN PUT ON A DIFFERENT SET THAT'S PROBABLY WHY THEY'RE EXPENSIVE THEY'RE LIKE LITTLE COMPUTERS
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
LIKE IT COULD BE A COOL SORT OF YOU KNOW BECAUSE IT COULD BE CIRCULAR YOU KNOW OR SOMETHING WEIRD LIKE THAT JUST
YEAH
WELL LIKE SINCE IT JUST HAS THE CIRCLE THING YOU COULD MAKE IT A QUI A KIND OF COOL SHAPE
YEAH
S
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH YEAH YEAH
WELL IT COULD JUST BE SIMPLE INSTEAD OF BEING A L MASS
BECAUSE THE OTHER THING
I DIDN'T TELL YOU ALL MY PRESENTATION IS THAT PEOPLE FIND IT
UM WHAT OTHER BUTTONS WERE THERE
VOLUME OH WE'VE TS JUST SAID THAT
FIND THAT IT'S A BIG WASTE OF TIME TO HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO USE YOUR REMOTE AND THAT'S ANOTHER THING THEY COMPLAINED ABOUT
YEAH
MM
YEAH
SO OKAY
THIS IS JUST FOR T. V. IT'S NOT FOR OR IT IS DOES NEED TO BE COMPATIBLE WITH
CHANNEL SELECTION
I
UM
A D. V. D. IS SIMPLE YOU JUST HAVE PLAY PAUSE EJECT
YEAH
SO HOW DO YOU SWITCH
MENU
SO I'LL I'LL CHECK THAT AND UPDATE YOU ON THE NEXT BUT WE'LL HOLD OFF ON THAT 'CAUSE
YOU KNOW ACTUALLY OUR OUR NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENTS
I'M NOT SURE IF THEY MEANT O ONL USE ONLY FOR TELEVISION AS IN NOT FOR D. V. D. OR JUST NOT INTERNET TYPE THINGS
AND MENU MAYBE
OH YEAH
OKAY
SO LIKE IF WE HAD THAT
YEAH
BUT S YEAH UH
BUT D. V. D. PLAYERS USUALLY HAVE THEIR OWN REMOTE
SO I KNOW I'M NOT C REALLY CLEAR ON WHAT
THAT'S TRUE YEAH
YEAH
BUT IT'S COOL TO HAVE IT ALL ON ONE BECAUSE YOU WANNA TURN IT ON THEN YOU WANNA TURN UP THE VOLUME
AND THEN YOU WANNA GO TO THE MENU SO YOU DON'T WANNA SWITCH
YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH YEAH
MM
MM
YEAH
YOU KNOW SOMEWHERE SO LIKE YOU CAN YOU'RE EITHER ON T. V. YOU'RE ON D. V. D. OR YOU'RE ON V. C. R. OR YOU'RE LIKE
SO
SO YOU'D HAVE TO HAVE LIKE I THINK YOU WOULD HAVE TO HAVE LIKE A FUNCTION SWITCH BUTTON
YEAH
WELL BUT D. V. D. IS ONLY LIKE FOUR BUTTONS
YEAH IT IS ONLY FUN
YEAH BUT I MEAN LIKE TO SWITCH THE FUN SO LIKE TO SWITCH THE FUNCTION OF THE LITTLE CIRCLE DISC THE TOUCH PAD
BUT I
BUT I THINK THE CIRCLE ONLY DOES CHANNEL ISN'T APPLICABLE TO D. V. D. REALLY 'CAUSE YOU DON'T WANNA BUT VOLUME IS AND VOLUME IS ACTUALLY CONTROLLED ON THE T. V. SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO SWITCH
OH
YEAH
YEAH BUT IT IT WOULD BE
BUT THEN IF UH IF YOU'RE ON D. V. D. THEN LIKE THE CHANNEL BU LIKE THE THE REGION OF THE DISC THAT WAS FOR CHANNELS IS FOR LIKE SWITCHING TO DIFFERENT TRACKS OR S YOU KNOW
TO DIFFERENT I MEAN DO WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THAT THAT LIKE
SO LIKE YOU'RE IF YOU'RE ON T. V. LIKE YOU CAN SWITCH CHANNELS
SO BUT I'M SAYING LIKE DOES IT MAKE SENSE TO HAVE LIKE SOME KIND OF A BUTTON
SEE YOU SOON
UM LET'S SEE
UM YEAH SO THINK ABOUT THE THINGS WE'VE DISCUSSED AND BRING SOME NEW IDEAS TO OUR NEXT MEETING
UM SO EVERYONE'S GONNA GO FINISH THEIR QUESTIONNAIRE UH THEN WHEN WE COME BACK AFTER LUNCH WE'LL HAVE THIRTY MINUTES OF INDIVIDUAL WORK
UM YEAH LET'S THINK ABOUT IT 'CAUSE WE NEED TO WRAP UP
YES WE CAN TRY THAT
OKAY
ALRIGHT WE'RE MOVING ON TO CONCEPTUAL DESIGN
HI EVERYONE HOPE YOU HAD A NICE LUNCH
UM
'SCUSE ME
BLESS YOU
UM UNDER MARKETING WE TARGETED OUR AUDIENCE AND
UM I'LL JUST REVIEW WHAT WE DID IN OUR LAST MEETING
UM YEAH
UM THEN WE CONSIDERED SOME DESIGN OPTIONS WITH HOW IT SHOULD LOOK UM
THAT WAS GENERALLY HOW HELPFUL THAT WAS
WE DISCUSSED AN IPOD LIKE BUTTON SYSTEM WHICH UH WE HAVEN'T CONCLUDED BUT WE'RE
RIGHT UM
SO IF YOU ALL HAVE PRESENTATIONS TO DO WE CAN SEE WHAT WHERE YOU'VE COME FROM OUR LAST TIME
DOES EVERYONE HAVE PRESENTATIONS
HMM
YEAH
YES
WOULD ANYBODY LIKE TO GO FIRST
OKAY
YES
SURE
OKAY
SO I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THE COMPONENTS DESIGN
UM
MOSTLY BY CONSULTING REMOTE CONTROL DIAGRAMS FROM THE INTERNET AND ALSO BY INCORPORATING DESIGN IDEAS FROM THE LAST PROJECT MEETING
UM SO WE NEED SOME CUSTOM DESIGN PARTS AND OTHER PARTS WE'LL JUST USE STANDARD
UM I ASSUME WE'LL BE CUSTOM DESIGNING OUR CASE PROBABLY A HARD PLASTIC OR SOME OTHER MATERIAL CASE TO PROTECT THE REMOTE AND THE LOCATOR
AND WE'LL NEED TO CUSTOM DESI DESIGN A CIRCUIT BOARD
BECAUSE THE CIRCUIT BOARD HAS TO TAKE THE BUTTON INPUT AND SEND IT TO THE OUTPUT SO YOU HAVE TO DESIGN THAT EACH TIME
BUT ONCE WE COME UP WITH A DESIGN WE'LL SEND IT TO THE CIRCUIT PEOPLE AND THEY'LL JUST PRINT IT OUT
UM STANDARD PARTS INCLUDE THE BUTTONS AND THE WHEELS UM THE IPOD STYLE WHEEL
THE INFRARED L. E. D. IS ACTUALLY GONNA BE INCLUDED IN THE CIRCUIT BOARD THAT COMES WITH IT
UM WE NEED A RADIO SENDER AND RECEIVER THOSE ARE STANDARD
AND AL WE ALSO NEED A BEEPER OR BUZZER OR OTHER SORT OF NOISE THING FOR LOCATING THE REMOTE
SO WE HAVE SOME MATERIAL OPTIONS
UM I'D RECOMMEND AGAINST TITANIUM BECAUSE IT CAN ONLY BE USED IN THE FLAT CASES AND IT'S REALLY HEAVY
UM AND THE RUBBER CASE REQUIRES RUBBER BUTTONS SO IF WE DEFINITELY WANT PLASTIC BUTTONS WE SHOULDN'T HAVE A RUBBER CASE
UM WE CAN USE RUBBER PLASTIC WOOD OR TITANIUM
AND WHY NOT WOOD
AND WHY NOT WOOD
AND HMM
UM AND ALSO WE SHOULD NOTE THAT IF WE WANT AN IPOD STYLE WHEEL BUTTON IT'S GONNA REQUIRE A M QU SLIGHTLY MORE EXPENSIVE CHIP
WE CAN'T USE THE MINIMAL CHIP WE NEED THE NEXT HIGHER GRADE WHICH IS CALLED REGULAR
UH WELL WE CAN USE WOOD
I DON'T THINK IT'S MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE BUT IT IS MORE EXPENSIVE
I DON'T KNOW WHY WE'D WANT TO
SO THAT'S WHAT I'VE GOT ON DESIGN
'S GOOD
UM CAN I DO NEXT
'CAUSE I HAVE TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE MATERIAL
HMM
YEAH
WHICH IS QUITE SHOCKING
MM
HA
UM
AND TH LAST THING IS THE
RIGHT UM I HAVE BEEN SEARCHING THE CURRENT TRENDS UM BOTH ON THE WEB AND VIA FASHION WATCHERS
NEXT COMES TECHNOLOGIC TECHNOLOGY AND THE INNOVATIONS TO DO WITH THAT
AND THE FINDINGS ARE THAT THE FIRST THING TO AIM FOR IS A FASHION UH FANCY LOOK AND FEEL
UM
YOU KNOW WH WHATEVER OUR MOTTO IS
EASY TO USE UM FACTOR
UM OUR FASHION WATCHERS IN MILAN AND PARIS HAVE DECIDED WELL NOTICED
THAT F THE FRUIT AND VEGETABLE THEME IS THE IS THE CURRENT TREND AND AND THEREFORE UM WE NEED TO GO FOR THAT IF WE WANT
UM FANCY LOOK AND FEEL GOES FAR BEYOND THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE THING BUT I SUPPOSE THAT IS INCLUDED IN IN THE EASE OF USE
I DON'T KNOW HOW SPONGY CAN BE ACHIEVED BUT APPARENTLY THAT'S THE WAY TO GO
SO WE WANT TO PUT THE FASHION ELECTRONICS WE NEED TO GO FRUIT AND VEGETABLES
FOR FASHION WE GO FOR FASHION
AND ALSO GO FOR A SPONGY FEEL SO THE THE QUESTION OF OUR TECHNOLOGY WHATE IS INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER
AS TO THE MATERIAL SHOULD BE LIMITED TO I DON'T KNOW HOW SPONGY IT CAN BE SHOULD DISCUSS THIS TOGETHER
THE FASHION IN ELECTRONICS
MM
UM
I THINK I THINK PEOPLE LIKE TO HAVE A FRUIT INSTEAD OF A VEGETABLES IN THEIR SITTING ROOM
I I HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THIS FRUIT AND VEGETABLE THING AND I PREFER FRUITS TO VEGETABLES BUT THAT'S JUST A PERSONAL OPINION
SO THAT STILL HAS TO DO WITH THE MATERIAL DISCUSS SHOULD WE PRINT THE FRUIT STUFF OR SHOULD THE ACTUAL REMOTE LOOK LIKE A FRUIT
UH THOSE ARE JUST SUGGESTIONS AND ALSO WE NEED TO DECIDE WHETHER THIS SHOULD BE PRINTED
IT HAS TO BE TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE SO MAYBE AGAIN OUR INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER SHOULD LOOK INTO THAT OR FIND COME UP WITH A SOLUTION THAT'S BETTER THAN MINE
UM YEAH TO SUMMARISE THESE ARE THE POINTS THAT NEED TO BE
UM AND FINALLY AGAIN WITH THE SPONGY
THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION
UM TOUCHED IN ORDER TO GET A GOOD DECISION AND HOPEFULLY OUR USER INTERFACE HAS MORE TO SAY ABOUT THE MATTER
MM-HMM
SO
I THINK IT'S THE NEXT IT'S THE BLUE ONE YEAH
UH
OH UH THERE WE GO
UM
OKAY
I ACTUALLY WASN'T AWARE OF THE NEW TRENDS IN ELECTRONICS AND AND UH
WELL SO THAT FRUIT AND VEGETABLES THING HUH
NEITHER WAS I
WELL IT'S A TREND IN FASHION IN CLOTHING AND UM FABRICS
YEAH BUT YOU'RE NOT GONNA WEAR YOUR REMOTE CONTROL
SO SO OKAY LET ME GET THIS RIGHT
OKAY UH
TRYING WE'RE GONNA TRY TO TALK ABOUT UM WHAT KIND OF UH HOW PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE USING THIS IPOD ISH REMOTE CONTROL
CONCEPTUAL USER INTERFACE
OKAY ALRIGHT ANYWAY
UM HERE WE GO
UM KIND OF I MEAN I ASSUME ARE WE STILL ON THE SCREEN IDEA
AND UM BASICALLY SO THIS IS A TOUCHED BA A TOUCH BASED GRAPHICAL INTERFACE SYSTEM
BASED ON FRUIT VEGETABLE DESIGN
UH SO PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT THIS LITTLE SCREEN
OH WE S HADN'T DISCUSSED IT LAST TIME
'CAUSE IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO HA IF WE HAVE THIS IT JUST SEEMS LIKE IN ORDER TO HAVE SOMEONE GOING AROUND AND USING THE UM THE WHEEL
YOU NEED A SCREEN FOR IT
YOU IT SEEMS LIKE YOU WOULD NEED A SCREEN
WITH T. V. CHANNELS IT'S YOU KNOW ONE TWO THREE
YOU NEED A SCREEN WITH MUSIC BECAUSE YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A SPECIFIC SONG LIKE YOU KNOW THAT BAND OR WHATEVER
SO
BUT LIKE IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT YEAH BUT IF SO IS IT JUST OKAY
ARE WE
SO B YOU YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO SWITCH TO LIKE D. V. D. AND LIKE OTHER THINGS LIKE THAT AREN'T YOU
WE'RE UM WE'RE ACTUALLY NOT HAVING D. V. D. THAT WAS ONE OF TH I I WAS SORRY I I MEANT TO UPDATE YOU ON THAT
UM
YEAH
ALRIGHT
OKAY
OKAY
THAT CORRECT
BUT THE SCREEN CAN COME UP ON THE TELLY THE SHE SAID
UM YOU KNOW CHANNELS ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT NINE
OKAY
SO ANYWAY IF WELL WE JUST WE NEED TO OKAY SO IF WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE A SCREEN I THINK I WAS THINKING OKAY
SO THAT PEOPLE SEEMS TO BE WELL
AND YOU'RE JUST GONNA I MEAN I THINK YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO HAVE SOME KIND OF A RIGHT
BUT LIKE CHOOSE CHANNEL CONTROL LIKE IF YOU WA BECAUSE PEOPLE AREN'T GONNA BE ABLE TO HAVE LIKE
OKAY
YEAH LIKE YOU'RE G YEAH LIKE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO BE ABLE TO SWITCH TO LIKE A MODE WHERE YOU CAN OKAY WE'RE NOT CHOOSING THAT I GUESS
SO BASICALLY IT'S JUST GONNA BE A WHEEL THEN
YEAH
GRAPHICAL INTERFACE
UH ON THE YOU CAN HAVE IT ON THE TELLY THOUGH
YEAH
YEAH
YOU'VE YEAH I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING YOU HAVE TO
YOU KNOW
BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO SCROLL TO GET CHANNELS
SO UM I GUESS THAT'S WH WHY I WAS THINKING YOU MAY NEED TO HAVE SOME KIND OF A SCREEN BECAUSE
YOU CAN JUST SCROLL AND YOU CAN JUST GET TO LIKE FIVE OR LIKE TWELVE OR
SO THAT PEOPLE CAN GO AROU GO BACK AND FORTH AND CHOOSE IF OR OR THEN AGAIN IF YOU JUST I GUESS I C I CAN SEE LIKE SOME KIND OF A THING WHERE LIKE YOU SORT OF HAVE LIKE THE NUMBER COME UP ON THE T. V. LIKE WHAT CHANNEL YOU'RE ON
YEAH YEAH
YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH
BUT BUT IMAGINE SOMEONE WITH S
MY FLATMATES ACTUALLY HAD ONE WITH A WHEEL AND IT IT DID SHOW UP ON THE T. V.
I OH YEAH
BUT I WHAT IF YOU HAVE SATELLITE AND YOU HAVE LIKE TWO HUNDRED CHANNELS
THEN TO GET TO CHANNEL ONE EIGHTY NINE YOU HAVE TO
'CAUSE YOU'LL HAVE TO LIKE BUT YOU CAN QUICKLY S YOU CAN
YEAH
THEY HAVE TO R WHEEL REALLY FAST
BUT I THINK THE WHEEL GOES THROUGH LIKE A HUNDRED CHANNELS AT LEAST ON THEIRS
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH IF YOU DO IT W SO IT WOULD HAVE TO BE YOU I MEAN SO YOU BASICALLY JUST KINDA NEED TO FIGURE OUT LIKE WHAT KIND OF
YOU KNOW RANGE WE NEED TO HAVE ON THE WHEEL AND UM
SO YOU'RE EITHER YOU'RE YOU KNOW TH YOU'RE EITHER DOING THIS MOTION TO LIKE CONTROL THE CHANNELS OR LIKE ONCE ONCE YOU STOP THAT
YOU KNOW YOU CAN LIKE TAP FOR UM DIFFERENT
YEAH
UH WHATCHAMACALLITS DIFFERENT UM YOU KNOW FUNCTIONS LIKE VOLUME OR LIKE YOU CAN TAP JUST TO GET TO DIFFERENT CHANNELS
LIKE IF YOU JUST WANTED TO GO TO LIKE FROM FIVE TO SIX YOU COULD TAP OR SOMETH
RIGHT
OR IF YOU WANT TO UM YOU KNOW SWITCH AROUND I DON'T KNOW
AND THEN THERE'S ALSO THE CONCERN ABOUT YOU KNOW UM HOW DO YOU GET TO THE MENU IF YOU WANNA CHANGE THE BRIGHTNESS OF YOUR TELEVISION
LIKE THESE DIFFERENT MODES LIKE TURN ON THE TIMER OR LIKE SOMETHING SOMETHING LIKE THAT LIKE
YEAH
I MEAN WITH THAT MANY OPTIONS YOU'D UH I'D THINK THAT THE SCREEN WOULD BE BETTER BECAUSE YOU COULD HAVE THAT MENU OPTION SORT OF
I WOULD THINK SO TOO LIKE
YOU KNOW BECAUSE BUT THEN AGAIN IT WOULD IT DOES MAKE KIND OF IF THE SCREEN'S SORT OF JUST LIKE AN OPTION THAT
SO I MEAN AND IT SEEMS IT W IT DOES SEEM A LITTLE SILLY TO HAVE THIS SCREEN IF YOU HARDLY ARE EVER USING IT
LIKE IS JUST THERE AND YOU'RE NOT REALLY USING IT THAT'S KIND OF M YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
WHICH IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE REGULAR CHIP WHICH IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE MINIMAL
IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE ACCORDING TO THE DESIGN PEOPLE
YOU HAVE TO GET A AN ADVANCED CHIP IF YOU WANNA HAVE A SCREEN IN
UH
YEAH THAT'S THE ONLY THING THOUGH
SO THEN BASICALLY IT HAS TO HAVE SOME WAY TO GET TO GET TO A MODE ON THE TELEVISION WHERE YOU'RE DOING UM
YEAH
MM
YOU CAN GET TO YOU KNOW YOU CAN
LIKE MAYBE IT'LL BE THAT CENTRAL BUTTON THAT LIKE
THEN YOU HIT THAT AND THEN YOU CAN IT BRINGS UP LIKE THE MENU ON THE T. V. AND YOU CAN JUST SCROLL AROUND
LIKE TO DO THE TIMER TO DO THE YEAH YEAH
YEAH YEAH YEAH
MM-HMM
MM
YEAH
SO THE T. V. IS THE SCREEN THAT YEAH
YEAH
SO IT WOULD HAVE ALL THESE DIFFERENT OPTIONS OF CHANGING
YEAH
BUT THE REMOTE ITSELF ISN'T REALLY CLUTTERED UP
TO
LOOK IT EVEN HAS SETTINGS
OKAY
HMM
YEAH WELL WE DON'T WANT THE SCREEN I GUESS BUT UM 'CAUSE THAT JUST IT DOES SEEM LIKE IT THAT WOULD BE LIKE INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE
BUT I DUNNO AND THEN SO IT JUST IM REALLY ALL YOU NEED IS LIKE THIS LITTLE WHEEL THEN AND YOU CAN CONTROL EVERYTHING
ON THE YOU CAN JUST TAKE THEIRS AND JUST
YEAH
YEAH
SO
UM RIGHT
UM AND YOU JUST HAVE THIS IT'S LIKE JUST A LONG SILVER THING OR WHATEVER WE'RE THINKING
OR
I MEAN ARE YOU YOU GONNA HAVE ANY BUTTONS ON THAT BESIDES POWER AND THIS THING
WHAT IF I MEAN IF YOU'RE THINKING OF THE DESIGN OF IT NOW LIKE THE A YOU KNOW PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES
YEAH
IT DOESN'T SEEM THAT YOU WOULD NEED ANYTHING BESIDES POW I MEAN AND THE POWER BUTTON COULD EVEN BE LIKE HOLD DOWN THE MENU BUTTON FOR LIKE LONGER THAN ONE SECOND AND IT TURNS ON THE T. V.
YEAH
SO CAN WE IMAGINE THAT THIS WOULD BE SMALLER THAN THE REMOTE CONTROLS THAT YOU SHOWED US BEFORE
I MEAN OKAY
YEAH
LIKE I THINK WE'RE LOOKING AT SOMETHING THAT COULD BE LIKE
YEAH DEFINITELY
I MEAN IT IT NEEDS TO BE EASY TO SOMEHOW IT NEEDS TO BE EASY TO LIKE MANIPULATE AND USE YOUR
LIKE EVEN MAYBE LIKE A CIR I'M F I'M SEEING ALMOST LIKE A CIRCULAR SORT OF LIKE HANDHELD LIKE THING
YEAH BUT SHOULD BE COMFORTABLE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
I MEAN HOW DO HOW DO I'M NOT REALLY
LIKE WHEN I USE AN IPOD I END UP JUST KIND OF USING MY INDEX FINGER TO LIKE CONTROL IT
SO
YEAH I'VE SEEN SOME PEOPLE JUST GOING LIKE THAT WITH THEIR THUMB YEAH
SO
OR YOUR THUMB OR SOMETHING
YEAH
YEAH I USE IT LIKE THAT
W WHEN WE HAD THE WHEELY REMOTE CONTROL WE IT WAS ON THE TOP I THINK IF YOU HELD IT LIKE THAT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH SO
YEAH
BUT WERE THERE BUTTONS ON THERE AS WELL
YEAH WELL IT HAD THE WHEELY THING AND THEN IT HAD THOSE EIGHTEEN DIFFERENT BUTTONS THAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY DO
SO WE JUST USED THE TOP PART
YEAH
MM
MM YEAH
YEAH
YEAH SO BUT I MEAN I THINK IT COULD BE PRETTY SMALL
LIKE I D I MEAN YOU YOU WANT IT TO BE LARGE ENOUGH THAT
UH
YOU CAN
WHAT IF UM YOU HAD LIKE A B A COVER THAT WENT OVER BUTTONS THAT YOU DON'T USE VERY MUCH
LIKE YOU SO YOU COULD SLIDE IT UP IF YOU NEEDED TO LIKE CHANGE THE CONTRAST OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
SO THE OPTIONS ARE THERE BUT THEY'RE NOT IN INTERFERING WITH THE DESIGN AND THE PRACTICALITY OF IT
BUT CAN'T YOU JUST GET
LIKE UH YEAH JUST SOMETHING
DO DO YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT THOUGH
YEAH
YEAH LIKE MAYBE SOMETHING ON THE SIDE WHERE YOU SLIP A PANEL DOWN AND IT'S GOT A WHOLE BUNCH OF
K
WELL YOU CAN HAVE IT ON THE SETTINGS NO
YEAH THAT YOU CAN FLIP OVER YEAH YEAH
THAT KEEPS IT
YEAH BUT I MEAN DO YOU NEED THAT
IF IF YOU CAN GET TO YOU KNOW IF SO LONG AS YOU'RE ABLE TO BRING UP THE MENU ON THE T. V. SCREEN
YEAH I MEAN I GUESS THAT'S THE THING IS IS IF W I IF WE CAN DO THIS THAT'D PROBABLY BE
YEAH
REALLY
UH YOU WOULDN'T I DON'T I JUST DON'T THINK YOU WOULD EVEN NEED IT
YEAH
SO
YEAH YEAH
SO I GUESS WE HAVE TO LOOK INTO THE UM LIKE THE PROGRAMMING HOW THIS HOW THEY ACTUALLY PROGRAMME THESE THINGS AND IF THAT'S YEAH
MEAN
OH HOW THEY MAKE THE MENU SHOW UP ON THE T. V.
I MEAN YOU CAN DO IT YOU IT'S IT DOESN'T SEEM THAT HARD
I BELIEVE IT'S INS IT'S GOTTA BE INSIDE THE T. V. NOT INSIDE THE REMOTE
I DON'T KNOW
I MEAN IT WOULD Y WOULD THAT WOULD BE
THEY ALREADY DO IT
I MEAN I'VE NEVER BOUGHT A REMOTE
IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS REMOTE'S GOING TO BE PURCHASED SEPARATELY FROM THE TELEVISION WHICH IS A LITTLE
I'M NOT SURE
WELL
WELL THEY USUALLY ARE
MY I'VE NEVER BOUGHT JUST A REMOTE LIKE SO I DON'T I DON'T REALLY KNOW
BUT UM
NO
HUH
IT ALWAYS COMES WITH THE T. V.
I GUESS THAT'S RIGHT
LIKE BRINGING UP THE MENU SCREEN IF YOU NEED TO LIKE CHANGE THE DATE OR WHATEVER YOU KNOW
SO UM BUT I MEAN IT'S I'VE NEVER HAD A HARD TIME WITH LIKE MY REMOTES
AND I DON'T THINK THAT SHOULD UH THAT SHOULD BE TOO HARD
'CAUSE IT JUST DOESN'T COME UP EVERY DAY OR SOMETHING
YEAH IT MOST OF THE ONES WE'VE HAD HAVE HAD THE MENU BUTTON
'CAUSE IT'S NOT LIKE YOU NEED TO HAVE A BUTTON ACCESS TO LIKE CHANGE THE CONTRAST OR SOMETHING
YEAH
WELL SO
YEAH
SO DO WE NEED I DUNNO
THAT'S WHAT IT DOES ANYWAY
WELL I GUESS WE HAVE TO YOU KNOW THINK ABOUT BUT I MEAN YOU JUST BASICALLY NEED THE OUTPUT SIGNAL YOU KNOW TO BE ABLE TO BRING IT UP
MM-HMM
YEAH
OKAY
NEVER EVER
SO
THEY HAVE THESE SORT OF ABBREVIATIONS AND CODES THAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO UNDERSTAND AND I NEVER GET IT
BUT ALSO IF YOU HAVE IT ON THE SCREEN YOU CAN ACTUALLY WRITE EVERYTHING OUT BECAUSE THE PROBLEM WITH BUTTONS IS YOU LIKE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YOU DON'T KNOW THEY MEAN YEAH IT'S LIKE YEAH
YEAH
I THINK I THINK THE TOUCH BASED GRAPHICAL INTERFACE IS A REALLY UH COOL IDEA BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT IS SO OBNOXIOUS TO LIKE HAVE TO PUSH THOSE LIKE OKAY NOW I HIT THIS YOU KNOW
YOU HAVE YOUR LITTLE GUIDE OUT AND YOU'RE LIKE HIT THIS BUTTON TWICE LIKE TO ACTIVATE THE DATE
SO YEAH I THINK I MEAN
SO BUT OH YOU MEAN IF WE HAVE THIS SCREEN LIKE THE IPOD SCREEN
ON THE TELLY OKAY YEAH
WELL ON THE TELLY
OR ON THE T. V. TOO
MM
AND IT IS TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE IN A WAY SO THAT FITS WITH THE
MM
I GUESS
AND IT IS TRENDY THE IPODS ARE REALLY HOT RIGHT NOW SO
YEAH
B
YEAH
DID YOU DID YOU GET THAT PC PICTURE ON DID THEY PROVIDE YOU WITH THAT PICTURE ON THE WEB
UM YEAH BY WEB RESEARCH YEAH SO
THAT'S QUITE INTERESTING
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT THIS VEGETABLE THING THAT I'M DREADING
OH GOD
OH I WAS GONNA SAY
UM ONE OF YOUR ONE OF THE MATERIAL OPTIONS IS A SORT OF RUBBER THAT'S IN LIKE THOSE STRESS BALL THINGS
YOU SAID UH PEOPLE WANT SPONGY
SO THAT WOULD BE SPONGY
OH
YEAH
YEAH
MM
OH OKAY THAT WOULD BE COOL
YEAH
YEAH
AH
YEAH
JUST NICE FEEL BUT I HATE SPONGY
USUALLY LIKE THE TOUCH PAD THINGS ARE KIND OF A HARD PLASTIC TYP MOUSE TYPE YOU KNOW THING
YEAH C THAT'S E THAT WOULD BE KIND OF OH YOU KNOW
BUT WHAT IF WE HA WHAT IF WE HAD LIKE A SPONGY SORT OF LIKE STRESS BALLEY KINDA SO YOU'RE LIKE
YEAH
YEAH
I MEAN DEFINITELY THE AREA ROUND IT
YEAH I THINK IT COULD WORK
OR WHAT IF WE INTEGRATED THE THE UH THE F WHAT IF THE WHOLE THING ABOUT THE FRUIT AND VEGETABLES WE SOMEHOW MADE IT TACTILELY FASH YOU KNOW
WE C TAPPED INTO THAT SO LIKE IT FEELS LIKE
YEAH
DON'T THINK I'D WANT IT TO FEEL LIKE A BANANA
WELL IT COULD BE LIKE MOBILES THAT JUST YOU JUST PUT A COVER
A VEGETABLE
AN ORANGE
YEAH
YOU KNOW YOU HAD THERE WAS A TIME WHEN THEY HAD ALL THESE DIFFERENT COVERS FOR MOBILES
IF IT'S A SMALL THING YOU C INSTEAD OF CREATING AN OBJECT FOR IT THAT LOOKS LIKE A BANANA
WHICH FRANKLY I'M NOT PARTICULARLY FOND OF UM YOU COULD JUST HAVE COVERS AND THEN YOUR MOBILE F IT'S LIKE A MOBILE PHONE THING
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YOU COULD DO LIKE THE COMPUTERS WHERE THEY HAVE LIKE THE GRAPEFRUIT APPLE MACHINE AND THEY HAVE LIKE THE BLUEBERRY LIKE ALL THE COLOURS ARE NAMED AFTER FRUITS
YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YOU COULD NAME IT AFTER FRUITS AND VEGETABLES OR
YEAH
AND IT COULD THE COLOUR CAN FIT YOUR SITTING ROOM SO IF YOU HAVE RED SITTING ROOM YOU CAN HAVE STRAWBERRY
AND THEN IF YOU HAVE A GREEN ONE YOU CAN HAVE WELL I DON'T KNOW
UM
YEAH
UM
AND ON THAT HARD PLASTIC THING YOU CAN CHANGE EITHER THE COLOUR OR THE FRUIT OR VEGETABLE THAT'S ON THERE
SO WHAT IF WHAT THIS IS I'M JUST FORMING THIS IDEA IN MY HEAD OF HOW THIS THING IS LOOKING
IF YOU HAVE LIKE THAT STRESS BALL MATERIAL KIND OF AS WHAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY HOLDING IN YOUR HAND
IS THAT KIND OF I 'CAUSE I I'M THINKING OF SILVER BECAUSE THOSE ARE OUR COMPANY COLOURS
SO LIKE WHAT YOU'RE FEELING IS COMFORTABLE AND THEN THERE'S MORE OF A HARD PLASTIC THING WHERE THAT THING IS
SO I THINK YEAH COLOURS
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
UM
YEAH
I DO I DUNNO
UNFORTUNATELY THEY DON'T HAVE SILVER FRUITS AND VEGETABLES
I MEAN HOW ARE YOU HOW ARE YOU ALL ENVISIONING BY WHAT WE'VE JUST THE FEEDBACK WE'VE JUST GOT ABOUT THE
MAYBE A BALL
A BALL
KNOW A SQUASHY BALL
A RELAXING SQUASHY BALL
YOU'RE THINKING THE OPPOSITE OF ME 'CAUSE YOU'RE THINKING YOU CHANGE THE THE HARD BIT AND I'M THINKING HOW DO YOU CHANGE THE HARD WOULD YOU PUT A UM
THAT YOU CAN P WELL I SEE YOU'RE THINKING IT'S WEIRD
THAT'S IN THE SHAPE OF A FRUIT LIKE A
YEAH
BECAUSE I WAS THINKING IF YOU HAVE A COVER FOR THE SQUASHY BIT LIKE A
STICKER SORT OF
THIS IS JUST
OKAY
SAY THAT'S THE S SAY THAT'S THE SQUASHY BIT
SQUASHY
OH OKAY YEAH
YEAH I WAS THINKING OF GETTING A COVER FOR
AND LIKE THIS YOU COULD HAVE LIKE YOU COULD HAVE LIKE CHERRIES AND THINGS AROUND THERE
UM BUT
THAT SEE I WAS THINKING THIS S SORRY I WAS THINKING THIS BIT HERE WOULD BE THE COVER AND LIKE THAT'S YOUR ACTUAL THING
WHICH IS CHEAPER
WELL I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S CHEAPER ACTUALLY
MM
OH
OH I LIKE THAT SHAPE
YEAH
YEAH
I WAS THINKING SORT OF A SINGLE BALL SHAPE
SO YOU'RE HOLDING A SQUISHY BALL AND THEN IT HAS A
YEAH
I WAS THINKING IF IT WAS LIKE THIS 'CAUSE THE WAY YOU WERE DESCRIBING THE THE IPOD AND THE THI THE ROLL THINGY
IT'S LIKE IT HAS TO BE S YEAH
MM-HMM
IT'S ALMOST LIKE YOUR THUMB IS FARTHER UP SO IF IF YOU COULD SQUISH IT LOWER THEN
YEAH I GUESS SO
YEAH
YEAH
THIS BIG AND THEN YOU JUST DO THAT I SUPPOSE
SO IT WOULDN'T BE VERY BIG IN EITHER LIKE HOW BIG
AND YOU CAN SO SO MAYBE ONE YOU KNOW YOU CAN HAVE LIKE THE BROCCOLI SQUISHY THING
AND THEN YOU COULD HAVE LIKE THE BANANA SQUISHY THING AND YOU COULD GET YOU COULD HAVE YOUR CHOICE YOU KNOW
WHAT IF YEAH WHAT IF THE SQUISHY OH SO SO YOU'RE SAYING THE SQUISHY PART'S LIKE DETACHABLE
YEAH I KNOW WHAT YOU MEANT YEAH
BUT WELL THE QUESTION IS WHICH ONE'S EASIEST TO CHANGE AND WE CAN JUST CONTACT OUR RELEVANT DEPARTMENT FOR THAT
WELL JUST A LI I CAN'T DES LIKE CONDOM THINGY LIKE A A COVER
AND FOR NOW WE CAN DO TWO PROTOTYPES MAYBE AND THEN HI TRY AND ASK USERS WHAT THE BEST IS AND
AND JUST SEE WHAT THE COST IS FOR COVERING THAT OR COVERING THAT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
MM
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
OH
NO
I THINK IT'S NICER TO HAVE A DRAWING 'CAUSE IT'S NEATER
THAT'S NICER
UM
YEAH
HMM
UM
WELL THAT'S NOT VERY NEAT BUT
I MEAN I THINK UH AND I THINK THE HANDHE I THINK THE HANDHELD PART IS DEFINITELY
YEAH
SO YOU COULD MAKE THAT
INTO THE FRUIT AND VEGETABLE PART
IF IT'S A BIT LIKE THOSE JUGGLING BALLS YOU CAN CHANGE SHAPE ACCORDING TO YOUR
IF IT'S GOT SAND IN IT MAYBE OR SOMETHING YOU IT IT JUST MOULDS TO YOUR HAND
TO THE WAY YOU HOLD IT
YEAH YOU COULD SQUISH IT
MM-HMM
YEAH
SO WHERE ARE THE FRUIT AND VEGETABLES NOW
YEAH
WE WE DON'T KNOW
FRUITS AND VEG
I GUESS THEY WOULD BE EITHER IN THE COLOUR OF THAT PLASTIC FACE ON THE FRONT OR IN THE COLOUR OF THE SQUISHY THING UNDERNEATH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
AND THE REST IS THE COMPANY THE COMPANY COLOUR'S SILVER
IT L IT LOOKS LIKE I DON'T
IT WAS YEAH SILVER AND YELLOW
LIKE MM
WE COULD PROMOTE THE BANANA ONE
OKAY
YEAH
I MEAN THAT'S ANOTHER QUESTION WHERE ARE WE GONNA WE WE SHOULD HAVE THE LOGO SOMEWHERE ON IT
MM
SHOULD ALSO FIT THE BATTERIES WHICH WE HAVEN'T
MM-HMM
OH YEAH
YEAH
I THINK THE BATTERIES WOULD HAVE TO GO RIGHT UNDER THE PLASTIC CASE
YEAH TH AND THAT WOULD THAT
YEAH
OKAY
THEN YOU NEED TO HAVE THE OTHER PART JUST BE SORT OF A SINGLE UNIT THAT YOU CAN SNAP OFF
ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE SWITCHING OUT THE SQUISHY PART
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH I THINK UM
IT'D BE INTERESTING TO HAVE THE B THE SQUISHY BIT
THE PART THAT YOU YEAH CAN CHANGE INTO THE DIFFERENT YOU KNOW TRENDY VEGETABLES AND FRUITS
BUT UH IT
THEN YOU'D GET A NEW ONE AND YOU'D HAVE TO DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN
WELL I DUNNO
YOU'D SPEND SO MUCH TIME LIKE SQUISHING IT TO YOUR OWN PERSONAL HAND
YEAH
NO BUT IT DOES IT AUTOMATICALLY
I DON'T KNOW
DOES IT AUTOMATICALLY
YEAH
QUESTION MARK
BUT IF SOMEONE COMPONENTS CONCEPT
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE REST OF MY NOTES MEAN BECAUSE THEY WERE MADE FOR ME
YEAH
UM SO WHAT D BUT WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT
OKAY
WAS THAT YOU
OH RIGHT RIGHT
ENERGY
QUESTION MARK
OKAY
THAT WAS ME
YES
AND
ENERGY
I MEAN WE'RE GONNA USE BATTERIES RIGHT
SOMETHING TO DO WITH TORCHES
UH WE ACTUALLY HAD AN OPTION OF BATTERIES SOLAR POWER AND UM A DYNAMO WHICH IS SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS
IT'S THE EN IT'S LIKE IF IF SOMETHING MOVES WHEN IT MOVES IT STORES ENERGY
OH A DYNAMO IS AH IT'S A BICYCLE
IT'S A BICYCLE MECHANISM
OH OKAY
YEAH THE OTHER ONE WAS THE OTHER ONE WAS A KINETIC THING WHERE YOU'D BASICALLY HAVE TO WIND IT YOURSELF
WE COULD HAVE TALKED ABOUT DOING A WIND UP OR A DYNAMO OR A SOLAR POWER
UM BUT I THINK SOLAR POWER'S NOT AVAILABLE WITH THE RUBBER CASE ANYWAYS
SO I SORT OF PICKED BATTERY
IT'S QUITE SWEET
I THINK BATTERIES SOUND GOOD
WHAT DOES EVERYONE ELSE THINK
IT IT SEEMS A LITTLE WEIRD FOR A LIVING ROOM ANYWAYS
THE DYNAMO WOULD BE INTERESTING
BUT DYNAMO THE THE FACT WITH DYNAMO IS THE MOMENT YOU MOVE IT IT C IT CREATES ENERGY ON ITS OWN
NO
OH
WHAT ABOUT KRYPTONITE
BUT WE NEED TO FIND COST
SO IF YOU THROW IT IT'S GONNA STORE LOADS OF ENERGY AND YOU DON'T NEED TO BUY A BATTERY 'CAUSE THEY'RE QUITE F I FIND THEM ANNOYING
WHICH IS QUITE COOL
YEAH
DON'T KNOW THE COST
DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH DATA TO ACTUALLY
DOES ANYONE HAVE COSTS ON THE ON THE WEB
ALL IT SAID WAS IT GAVE SORT OF RELATIVE SOME CHIPS ARE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN OTHERS SORT OF THINGS
IT DIDN'T GIVE ME ANY ACTUAL COST
OKAY
RIGHT
HMM
MM
MOST OF THE STUFF IS PRETTY CHEAP THOUGH BOUGHT IN BULK
SO I DON'T THINK IT'S THAT MUCH OF A PROBLEM
LIKE THE CHIP IS PROBABLY THE MOST EXPENSIVE PART
WHAT DOES CHIP ON PRINT MEAN
UM SO YOU CAN MASS PRODUCE 'EM PRETTY CHEAP
UM FOR THINGS LIKE REMOTE CONTROLS UM THEY STAMP OUT A CHIP CALCULATORS TOO I THINK
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE A COMPUTER YOU CAN'T LIKE REPROGRAMME YOUR REMO REMOTE CONTROLS IT'S LIKE STAMPED ONTO THE CHIP
UH-HUH
OKAY
RIGHT
CASING
UH I GUESS THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT YEAH
YEAH
AND CASE
SO CHIP ON PRINT IS JUST MEANS LIKE THAT THEY'RE MASS PRODUCED
OKAY
YEAH
CASE IS WHAT WE WERE DISCUSSING YEAH
THINKING OF LIKE SYNTACTIC CASE AND THI UM LET'S SEE
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE WE NEED TO
HMM
OH WHEN WE MOVE ON YOU TWO ARE GOING TO BE PLAYING WITH PLAY DOUGH
TALK ABOUT
UM AND WORKING ON THE LOOK AND FEEL OF THE DESIGN AND USER INTERFACE DESIGN
AND YOU'RE GONNA BE DOING PROTU PRODUCT EVALUATION
SO YOU'LL GET MM M MORE INSTRUCTIONS FROM YOUR PERSONAL COACH
OH THANK YOU
MM
COOL
SEE YOU SOON
DOES IT MATTER THAT I END EARLY
I IT'S STRANGE BECAUSE
HOW HOW EARLY IS IT
I DIDN'T GET A POP UP THING THAT SAID
'KAY
HMM
UM
OKAY EVERYBODY
WELCOME TO THE DETAILED DESIGN MEETING
UM AND SEE IF IT'S CHANGED AT ALL FROM WHEN WE LAST DISCUSSED IT
LAST TIME WE DISCUSSED THE SQUISHY FRUITINESS OF OUR REMOTE CONTROLS AND HOW WE MIGHT PURSUE THAT
UM SO ACTUALLY I THINK
UM AND WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT MATERIALS WE'D USE AND WHAT KIND OF CHIP WOULD BE NECESSARY
LET'S SEE
OUR AGENDA
UM AND I THINK LOOKS LIKE WE'VE COME UP WITH SOME IDEAS
UM SO FOR LATER IN THE MEETING I'VE DONE A A SPREADSHEET OF PRODUCTION COSTS SO WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT THAT
YEAH UM F YOU GUYS WANNA GIVE A PROTOTYPE PRESENTATION OF
OKAY WELL UM
SO OUR DESIGN LOOKS SOMETHING LIKE THIS
THIS BEING THE WHEEL THAT YOU USE TO UH CHANGE CHANNELS OR VOLUME OR WHATEVER
THIS IS A BUTTON SERVES AS THE POWER BUTTON IF YOU HOLD IT DOWN AND IF YOU JUST TAP ON IT I THINK IT BRINGS UP THE MENU
THIS ONE'S BROCCOLI
SO THIS SNAPS OFF AND YOU CAN PUT ON WHICHEVER ONE YOU WANT
AND UH THE BASE OF THE REMOTE CONTROL WHICH HAS A SQUISHY SPONGY RUBBERY FEEL IS INTERCHANGEABLE
SO YOU CAN CHANGE THE COLOUR ACCORDING TO YOUR TO SUIT YOUR LIVING ROOM OR WHATEVER
AND IT COMES YEAH I CAN CHANGE THE VEGETABLE
THIS IS NOT TO SCALE 'CAUSE IT WOULD HAVE THE BATTERY INSIDE IT
YOU COULD CHANGE THE VEGETABLE OR FRUIT
OH IS THAT BROCCOLI
YEAH
UM I GUESS STRAWBERRY'S NOT AS TRENDY BUT
THE IT'S TRENDY FRUIT IT'S NOT JUST ORDINARY FRUITS
THIS IS A MANGO
YOU DON'T HAVE ORANGE YOU HAVE MANGO
'S A VERY BRIGHT STRAWBERRY
SO WE'LL COME UP WITH A VARIETY OF TRENDY AND EXCITING FRUIT DESIGNS FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL
IT'S BEEN A L
AND THEN PEOPLE WILL BE ENCOURAGED TO BUY THREE OR FIVE OF THEM BECAUSE THEY'LL NEED TO SWITCH 'EM OUT
HOW HOW SO
AND I GUESS THE ONLY OTHER THING THAT WE REALLY DIDN'T TALK ABOUT WAS OR DESIGN YET ACTUALLY WOULD BE THE UM THING THE LOCATOR
UH BUT WE THINK THAT THIS YOU KNOW THIS SIZE WILL BE OKAY AND WE WILL HAVE TO FIT THE BATTERY CASE IN THERE SOMEHOW
IT'S BEEN A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT TO UM MAKE SURE THAT IT'S HAND HOLDABLE AND THAT THE USER CAN USE IT YOU KNOW IT'S NOT TOO BIG
MM-HMM
OH YEAH
WELL THE LOCATOR IS JUST CHIP THAT'S INSIDE THERE
OKAY SO THAT'S JUST
AND THE BEEPER'S ALSO INSIDE THERE TOO SOMEWHERE
SO YOU HAVE TO HAVE A BUTTON ON YOUR ON YOUR YOU HAVE TO ATTACH THE BUTTON TO THE
YEAH WE DIDN'T DESIGN THAT
YEAH WE HAVE THAT THAT HAS YES YET TO BE DESIGNED
BUT IT WOULD BE COORDINATING WITH THAT OF COURSE
YEAH THAT C HEY THAT THAT COULD YOU KNOW MATCH THE HANDSET
YEAH
MM-HMM
YOU COULD HAVE A BROCCOLI OR YOU COULD HAVE A MANGO
TADA
SO
OH
UM IF YOU WANNA LOOK IN YOUR PROJECT DOCUMENTS FOLDER THERE'S AN EXCEL SPREADSHEET
BUT IF I MISSED ANYTHING THAT WE'VE GONE OVER OR IF YOU SEE SOMETHING THAT HAS CHANGED I MEAN WE DECIDED ON BATTERIES
UM I'VE JUST STUCK THE NUMBERS IN IT WAS A REAL CHALLENGE THERE
UM
UM THE ONLY ONE THAT'S IN THERE PRODUCTION COSTS
AND IF YOU OPEN IT UP
AND THE REGULAR CHIP WOULD BE NECESSARY FOR THE MORE ADVANCED IPOD LIKE BUTTON
I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE THERE IS THAT RIGHT
I SAID UNCURVED OR FLAT
FOR THE FOR THE PLASTIC PART WOULD BE
MY IMPRESSION WAS THAT FLAT MEANT LIKE LIKE ONE OF THOSE SQUARE REMOTES
BUT IT'S REALLY NOT VERY CLEAR BECAUSE YOU GOT SINGLE CURVE AND DOUBLE CURVE AND D I DUNNO WHAT THAT MEANS
ONE SIDE IS CURVED AND THEN THE OTHER SIDE IS CURVED
OKAY
OH
RIGHT
WELL YEAH
IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE AREA JUST OH I D
UM SO WHAT ELSE
I DUNNO
I GUESS WE'D HAVE TO CONTACT THE COMPANY THAT MAKES THEM AND SEE
DO YOU SEE ANYTHING THAT I'VE MISSED
UM AND LOTS OF SPECIAL COLOURS ACTUALLY
UH SCROLL WHEEL
THERE'S PLASTIC FOR THAT AREA AROUND THE BUTTON
UM AND THEN RUBBER WOULD BE THE SQUISHY LIKE THING RIGHT
MM-HMM
NO I THINK THAT'S ALRIGHT
WHICH IS EVEN LESS THAN TWELVE POINT FIVE WHICH MEANS WE'D BE MAKING EVEN MORE OF A PROFIT
AND IF WE SOLD A LOT OF SQUISHY THINGS
BOO YEAH
OKAY SO THAT WOULD MAKE OUR TOTAL OF ELEVEN POINT NINE
MM
OKAY
S
SO
MM
THE
DID Y WHAT DID YOU WORK ON
UM EVALUATION CRITERIA
I'VE GOT A PRESENTATION
DO YOU WANNA
OKAY
OKAY
I THINK THAT'S
SO I NEED WHERE'S THE CABLE
RIGHT WHAT HAPPENS IS WE HAVE TO UM DECIDE WHETHER THIS THIS WHOLE
THIS WHOLE PROJECT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON ACTUALLY UM MEETS THE STANDARDS WE WERE SET AT THE START
UM
RIGHT
UM THE METHOD IS WE WELL I'VE ANALYSED THE USER REQUIREMENTS AND INTEGRATED THEM TO THE TRENDS FOUND IN MARKETING REPORTS AND IN OUR COMPANY STRATEGY MARKETING
THIS DOESN'T OKAY
AND UM THE FINDINGS WERE THAT WE NEED IT TO LOOK IN A CERTAIN WAY FEEL IN A CERTAIN WAY AND THIS IS EVERYTHING'S LISTED DOWN
THESE ARE ALL THINGS WE LOOKED AT AT THE START UM AND CRITERIA THAT HAVE TO BE MET
WE HAVE TO USE A TABLE I'LL SHOW YOU THAT LATER TOGETHER TO DECIDE WHETHER IT MEETS THE STANDARDS
UM LOOK IN A CERTAIN WAY FEEL IN A CERTAIN WAY IT HAS TO BE TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE AND IT HAS TO BE EASY TO USE
AND WE WE HAVE THEREFORE IN TOTAL UM
I WOULD LIKE TO SHOW YOU THE TABLE WE HAVE TO USE
WE HAVE FIVE WE HAVE ELEVEN POINTS ACCORDING TO WHICH THIS SHOULD BE EVALUATED
AND UM THE CRI WELL BASICALLY THE FINDINGS ARE THE SAME AS THE EVALUATION CRITERIA
UM
THIS IS THE TABLE
CAN YOU SEE THIS HERE
NO
MM-HMM
TRUE IS ONE AND AND FALSE IS SEVEN
UM SO THE QUE THE QUESTIONS I'VE GIVEN YOU C COULD YOU WRITE THAT DOWN
UM
AND WE'LL JUST GO THROUGH EACH POINT TOGETHER HOPEFULLY
I THINK IF EACH OF US GIVES AN OPINION THEN THEY CAN BE MIXED SOMEHOW
I DUNNO HOW IT WORKS EXACTLY I HAVEN'T BEEN TOLD
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT WE CAN BRING THIS UP ON OUR OWN
YEAH
YEAH IT'S IN THE UM
IT'S IN THE PROJECT DOCUMENTS
IS IT MEETING THREE MINUTES
NO IT'S NOT MINUTES
IT'S CALLED EVALUATION CRITERIA
OKAY
AND IT'S
UNDER EVALUATION
HUH THE POWERPOINT ONE
HMM
YEAH
OKAY
COOL
YOU'VE FOUND IT ALL
YEAH
SO IT WAS UM
YEAH TRUE'S ONE
TRUE'S ONE AND FALSE IS SEVEN
DO YOU WANT US TO DISCUSS THIS TOGETHER OR DO YOU WANT US TO DO IT SINGLY
UM WE CAN DO IT SEPARATELY AND THEN DISCUSS IT IF IF THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE WANNA DO
YEAH OKAY
SO IT'S ACTUALLY A SCALE
AND ONE IS
WAIT ONE IS TRUE AND SO THESE ARE THE QUESTIONS WE'RE ANSWERING
UM
YES IT'S IF IT'S FANCY YOU PUT ONE IF IT'S REALLY UNFANCY IT'S SEVEN
ONE RIGHT OKAY
IF IT'S SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN YOU PUT FOUR
OKAY
YEAH SOMETHING
OKAY
DOES IT FEEL FANCY
NO
FEELS LIKE PLAY DOUGH
THEY SHOULDN'T REALLY BE QUESTIONS
SHOULD BE MORE LIKE
ARE THE BATTERIES EASY TO INSERT
I'M GONNA SAY YES
YES
VERY VERY TRUE
OKAY
I IMAGINE THEY'RE SOMEWHERE ON THE FRONT
WE HAVE A LITTLE CASE THAT YOU SLIP 'EM IN
OKAY
ARE WE JUST ABOUT READY
APPARENTLY I'M SUPPOSED TO USE THE WHITEBOARD
DO WE UM IS IT NECESSARY
IT'S YEAH THE THE MARKER THING KINDA STOPPED WORKING LAST TIME WE
I DON'T THINK SO
WE'LL JUST DO UM
OKAY
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
OUR ANIMALS WILL FOREVER BE THERE
UN UNLESS YOU FEEL YOU NEED IT T TO OKAY OKAY
WE'LL
I DON'T FEEL ANY RIGHT UM
RIGHT SO ONE POINT ONE
WE'LL JUST GO IN A CIRCLE
ONE
'KAY
FIVE
ONE
RIGHT
RIGHT
OOH I DON'T KNOW
FIVE
FIVE
IS THAT WHAT THE COMPANY DOES
FIVE
OKAY SO DO WE JUST ADD IT UP AND DIVIDE IT BY FOUR
TWO
I I THINK WE SHOULD
IT'S FOUR IF YOU WANNA DO THAT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
IT ADDS TO SIXTEEN SO THAT'S FOUR
OH NO
ONE FIVE FIVE TWO
IT ADDS TO THIRTEEN
OH I THOUGHT SHE SAID FIVE
HMM
ONE FIVE FIVE TWO IS THIRTEEN OVER FOUR FOR NOW
I THINK THAT'S UM NEXT
UM THREE
SIX
SIX
I WASN'T CHEATING I SWEAR
UH OH
TWO
REALLY
YEAH
RIGHT
ONE POINT THREE IS
SO IT'S A ONE WAS TRUE AND SEVEN WAS FALSE
OKAY SO YOU GUYS REALLY DIDN'T LIKE IT
HUH
UH
YEAH
I REALLY
OH I THOUGHT IT WAS THE OTHER WAY ROUND
SO WE DO HAVE ABOUT THE SAME THING WE JUST HAVE IT THE OTHER WAY
WAIT A MINUTE
I THOUGHT IT WAS THE OTHER WAY ROUND TOO
WELL UH
SH
YEAH I I WAS THINKING ONE MEANS NO POINTS YOU KNOW ALL THE WAY UP TO THE TOP
YEAH YEAH
I SHOULD'VE KEPT THE TABLE UP
IT WAS ONE IS TRUE AND FALSE IS SEVEN
OKAY
WELL
OH GOSH
IT'S NO PROBLEM
I'LL JUST I'LL JUST REVERSE THEM ALL
YEAH
RIGHT WELL I'M GLAD THIS CAME OUT
YEAH
I THOUGHT YOU GUYS HATED IT
YEAH
I WAS LIKE WHY DID YOU GUYS DESIGN IT THAT WAY IF YOU HATED IT
YEAH
NO
OH THAT'S QUITE FUNNY
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH
SO STARTING AGAIN ONE POINT ONE
OKAY
ONE
SAY TWO
THREE
OKAY ONE POINT TWO
TWO

OH DEAR OKAY
YEAH
SORRY
ONE POINT FOUR ONE POINT FIVE
OKAY RIGHT THAT'S I HAVE TWO OF THEM
MINE HAS ALL KINDS OF PROBLEMS
TWO AND ONE
SORRY ABOUT THAT
T TWO POINT TWO WHICH IS ONE POINT FIVE

WAIT WHY DID I PUT THREE
UH ONE
I MEANT ONE ON MINE TOO
OKAY
THREE POINT ONE
IS THAT CORRECT ON MY SLIDE
YEAH

TWO AND FOUR POINT THREE
TWO
ONE TWO
ONE
TWO
I'M I'M SORRY THIS WAS SO TEDIOUS FOR EVERYONE
RIGHT SO I PUT ONE ON THAT
OR IS IT TEDIOUS
OKAY I'LL UM I'LL JUST DO THE CALCULATIONS NOW IF YOU WANT TO CONTINUE
UM
OKAY
NO NO THAT'S UM I THINK WE SHOULD LOOK AT THE ONES THAT LIKE WHERE S WHERE PEOPLE SAID FOUR
WHERE UM IT LOOKS LIKE WE MIGHT WANNA DISCUSS CHANGING AN ASPECT OF THE REMOTE
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW ELSE TO DO IT
OKAY
WELL THE WORST ONES WERE THREE POINT ONE
MM-HMM
DO DOES EVERY ONES HAVE THE SLIDE
THREE POINT ONE
THE THAT WAS MATERIAL
SLIDE SHOW
WHAT ARE THE SUGGESTIONS
I DON'T KNOW ANYONE
MATERIAL TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE OKAY
UM DO YOU WANT TO CHANGE IT
MM
UM
WHICH ONE IS THAT AGAIN SORRY
THREE POINT ONE
MM-HMM
FOUR POINT ONE
YEAH THAT IT'S THREE POINT ONE WAS NOT THAT GOOD
DOES THE SHAPE
FOUR POINT TWO
THE SHAPE
I THINK
SEE I'M HAVING I'M HAVING TROUBLE IMAGINING
IT OR BIGGER
THE IS IT UH GONNA BE THE SIZE LIKE THE THE CONTROLLER
I THINK THE WHEEL WOULD PROBABLY BE MM
BECAUSE
AND LIKE THEN IT YOU COULD HOLD IT IN YOUR HAND BETTER
WHAT IF WE JUST SMASH ALL THE VEGETABLES DOWN FLAT
I THINK THE BASE WOULD DEFINITELY BE LARGER 'CAUSE SOME OF THESE ARE NOT AS EASY TO HOLD
THEY'RE KINDA SMALLISH
YEAH
LIKE IF IT'S ROUND AND IT'S BIG THEN YOU YOU CAN'T GET THAT'S WHY REMOTE CONTROLS ARE LONG BECAUSE YOU HAVE THAT THUMB KIND OF SO C THEY COULD ALL BE BANANAS AND CUCUMBERS
UM BUT I DON'T S I I PERSONALLY DON'T THINK THIS IS COMFORTABLE TO TO SIT THERE LIKE IT'S AN AWKWARD POSITION
NO BUT I IMAGINE EVEN IF IT WAS BIGGER
YEAH
YEAH
THE FLAT ONE
YEAH
YEAH
I DIDN'T YEAH
BUT LIKE IF IF YOU JUST SQUASH THEM FLAT LIKE AND YOU MADE IT FLAT
WELL IF THEY'RE THAT S UH STRESS BALL STUFF THEY WOULD BE PRETTY SQUISHABLE
YEAH
BUT IT'S STILL TOO BIG I THINK IN YOUR HAND
MM
YEAH
AND WOULD IT EVEN RESEMBLE FRUIT THAT WAY
I MEAN
YEAH LIKE CERTAIN ONES YOU'D HAVE TO LIMIT THE FRUIT SELECTION LIKE YOU COULD PROBABLY DO A STRAWBERRY STILL
I THINK THE BROCCOLI WOULD BE OUT
YEAH
YEAH
YOU COULD DO ALTHOUGH THE BROCCOLI IS QUITE COMFORTABLE I HAVE TO SAY LIKE SORTA LIKE A JOYSTICK
YEAH THAT I I WHEN YOU WERE HOLDING THAT BEFORE IT ACTUALLY LOOKED YEAH
YEAH
THAT LOOKED REALLY GOOD
SO
I DON'T KNOW
ARE THERE ANY FRUITS THAT LOOK LIKE BROCCOLI NO
UH
RHUBARB
NOT THAT I CAN THINK OF
I THINK THAT BROCCOLI IS MY FAVOURITE ACTUALLY
UH DESPITE THE
THESE OBSCURE FRUITS
RHUBARB
YEAH
I THINK WE NEEDN'T
WHAT IF UM THE IT WAS JUST PATTERNS ON LIKE WE WE CHOSE THE SHAPE OR THE SH SHAPE COULD BE WHATEVER WE WANTED AND THEN IT WOULD JUST BE LIKE A DESIGN ON THE RUBBER
OH OKAY
HUH
YOU KNOW LIKE LIKE JUST A PRINTED YEAH OR COLOURED YEAH
SO IT'S JUST COLOUR AND NOT NECESSARILY THE SHAPE OF A STRAWBERRY
YEAH
THAT COULD WORK
YEAH
OR I MEAN WE COULD EVEN HAVE FRUIT LIKE AROUND I MEAN
YEAH
YEAH
I DUNNO
BUT IF WE IF WE NEED YEAH
AND IF WE WANNA INCORPORATE THE FRUIT THING SOMEHOW
THERE MIGHT BE I MEAN IF IT IF IT IN IF IT UH CONFLICTS WITH THE COMFORT OF ACTUALLY HOLDI HOLDING THE
YEAH AND JUST HAVE THE COLOUR MATCH OR SOMETHING
YEAH
'CAUSE YEAH NO ONE WANTS TO HOLD A REMOTE THAT'S UNCOMFORTABLE OBVIOUSLY
MM
MM
OR LIKE I DUNNO SOME OF 'EM YOU CAN KIND OF THINK SEE AS LIKE
LIKE YOU COULD IF IT WAS ONLY THIS YOU KNOW IF IT WAS SHAPED LIKE THAT AND IT JUST HAD THAT
BUT YOU SEE THE PROBLEM IS YOU HAVE TO ATTACH THAT AND THIS HAS TO BE DETACHABLE
YEAH
YEAH
SO LIKE MAYBE THAT'S JUST TOO BIG BECAUSE
WELL SEE TH THE REASON THE BROCCOLI WORKS IS YOU CAN KINDA HOLD IT LIKE THAT WHICH IS A NICE KIND OF YEAH
YEAH IT'S SORTA LIKE A JOYSTICK
YEAH
BUT
I GUESS
I DUNNO
'CAUSE LIKE KIND OF
I MEAN IS THERE SOME WAY WE COULD MAKE IT THIS KIND OF SHAPE
WE COULD MAKE IT THAT SHAPE BUT JUST HAVE DIFFERENT COLOURS AND CALL 'EM THE DIFFERENT FRUITS
WE WENT WITH SHAPE BECAUSE WE WERE HAVING FUN WITH THE PLAY DOUGH
YEAH YEAH
OR LIKE EVEN
YEAH
YEAH
DIF
OR EVEN LIKE
YOU KNOW
YEAH LIKE YOU SAID LIKE A JOYSTICK LIKE THAT
YEAH
YEAH
LIKE UH WE COULD DO I'M TRYING TO THINK OF OTHER SHA LIKE FRUITS THAT ARE ODDLY SHAPED
'CAUSE THAT I THINK
I MEAN THAT FITS THE WHOLE ROUND IPOD IDEA
AND YOU STILL HAVE THE COMFORT OF HOLDING IT LIKE THAT
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM
AND YOU COULD LIKE IF IT'S LIKE THIS YOU COULD PUT FRUIT DESIGNS AND STUFF ON THAT PART
YEAH
YEAH
ALRIGHT
BUT I MEAN IT DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER IDEAS ABOUT THAT
UM
WE COULD TR I DON'T KNOW
THINK THE CRITICAL ONES CAME OUT TO BE YEAH THAT ONE
BATTERIES EASY TO INSERT FOR SOME REASON WHICH CAN BE EASILY I THINK THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM ANY MORE
THE BATTERIES ARE GOING IN THE BACK
THAT EVERYONE GAVE THAT A ONE OR A TWO
YEAH THEY'D PROBABLY BE EITHER ON THE FRONT OR THE SIDE OF THE REMOTE
NO
THE REASON I I GA I DIDN'T GIVE IT A ONE I THINK I GAVE IT A THREE BECAUSE I THOUGHT YOU'D HAVE TO LIKE UNC CLIP NO YOU COULD
NO I IMAGINE THERE'D BE SORT OF A HATCH DOOR YEAH UM LIKE ON A NORMAL REMOTE
YEAH
OKAY
JUST LIKE ANY OTHER ONE
RIGHT
SO IT WOULD PROBABLY EITHER IN THE F NO IT CAN'T BE IN THE FRONT 'CAUSE THE I. R. 'S RIGHT THERE BUT IT'D BE ON ONE OF THE SIDES PROBABLY
OKAY
I THINK EVERYONE'S UNDER THREE ANYWAY
MM
SO I THINK IT'S YEAH THOSE ARE THE ONLY TWO POINTS
WELL
COOL
YEAH THE BROCCOLI I GUESS WINS
YEAH I'D AGREE WITH CHANGING THE SHAPE
UM I WAS JUST HAVING FUN MAKING STRAWBERRIES AND STUFF
YEAH
OKAY
WE WERE A BIT OFF TASK
UM SO UH I CAN'T THINK OF ANY
SO WE'LL HAVE TO LIKE
MM
YEAH I DUNNO
YOU COULD MAKE THE TOUCH PAD IN TH IN DIFFERENT SHAPES BUT THEN THAT KIND OF RE DESIGNS THE WHOLE PROJECT LIKE BUT YOU COULD DO LIKE
IT MIGHT ALSO SORT OF ANNOY PEOPLE IF WE GET USED TO HAVING THE BUTTONS IN ONE SHAPE
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
YEAH
YEAH
AND IT WOULD PROBABLY COST MORE TO PRODUCE 'CAUSE THEY'RE IRREGULAR
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
MM
I BET HAVING DIFFERENT COLOURS IS A LOT CHEAPER THAN HAVING DIFFERENT SHAPES TOO
YEAH
WHICH IS WHY PRINTING MIGHT BE LIKE JUST PRINTING THE FRUIT ON FRUIT
HMM
MM
NOT REALLY
UM SO PROJECT EVALUATION
WELL WE'VE DONE FINANCE EVALUATION CRITERIA PRODUCTION EVALUATION
DO YOU WANT THIS AND WE CAN ALL
NO
YEAH
I GUESS WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DISCUSS UM THE PROD THE PROCESS OF THE PROJECT AND HOW SATISFIED OH OH IT'S ALRIGHT
UM
UH
IT'S ALRIGHT YEAH
DID YOU FEEL THERE WAS A LOT OF ROOM FOR CREATIVITY IN THE SORT OF
SURE
YEAH
I DID
YEAH
I MEAN FRUIT AND SQUISHINESS
HOW C MORE CREATIVE CAN YOU GET
SPONGINESS
THE PROTOTYPE MAKING WAS VERY CREATIVELY STIMULATING AND I THINK WE'VE COME UP WITH A PRODUCT THAT'S FUN AND MEETS ALL THE CRITERIA
AND HOW WAS OUR LEADERSHIP AND TEAMWORK
WE KNEW WHAT WE WERE DOING
IT WAS A VERY DEMOCRATIC PROCESS AND EVERYONE GOT TO CONTRIBUTE
I THINK IT WAS GOOD
UM
WELL I THOUGHT MY LEADERSHIP WAS CRAP PERSONALLY
EXCUSE ME AM I ALLOWED TO SAY THAT
YEAH
WELL YOU TOLD US WHEN TO START AND WHEN TO END AND THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS
YOU DID A GOOD JOB LEADING
I THINK YOU WERE FINE
YEAH WELL I'M NEVER GONNA DO A MANAGEMENT POSITION I KNOW THAT NOW
UM YEAH I THOUGHT WE ALL WORKED VERY WELL TOGETHER
YEAH WE DIDN'T WE UH IT ALL C SORT OF BLENDED QUITE WELL
YEAH
YEAH I THINK IT MORE THAN ANYTHING WE DIDN'T REALLY HAVE OUR SET ROLES SO MUCH
AS WE JUST WOULD BE LIKE I DON'T KNOW ALL HAD IDEAS ABOUT IT BUT YEAH
VERY DEMOCRATIC
YEAH
UM AND THE MEANS FOR LIKE THE MATERIALS WE USED HOW CONVENIENT WERE THEY
NO SPATS THAT WAS GOOD
NO
LIKE THE THE PENS THE WHITEBOARD I MEAN WE USED
NO NO I NEVER TOUCH MACS EITHER
I JUST USE THE UNIX OR THE OFF MARKET SORT OF WORDPERFECT AND ALL THESE OTHER THINGS
WELL I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF ANY MICROSOFT POWERPOINT OR ANY OF THIS STUFF
ARE YOU A MAC PERSON
HUH
HMM
WHICH ISN'T VERY USER FRIENDLY THOUGH
WELL THE PROBLEM IS IF YOU DON'T LIKE MY NEW COMPUTER NEVER HAS WORDPERFECT SO I HAVE TO GO TRACK SOMEONE DOWN WHO HAS AN OLD DISK AND THEN I HAVE TO REINSTALL IT
YEAH
SO I HAVE ALL THESE DOCUMENTS I CAN'T USE NOW
BUT YEAH I MEAN I GUESS IT'S OKAY
I FELT LIKE MY I DUNNO IF IT WAS JUST MY ROLE
SO I KIND OF JUST MADE UP MY OWN STUFF AND I DIDN'T REALLY LIKE THE POWERPOINT PRESENTATIONS SO I KIND OF WROTE A LOT OF NOTES INSTEAD
BUT YEAH I D I DON'T REALLY LIKE POWERPOINT PERSONALLY THINK IT'S KINDA STUPID
BUT L BUT UH I DI I THOUGHT THAT MY THE INFORMATION THAT WAS AVAILABLE TO ME WAS KIND OF JUST LIKE OR MAYBE IT WAS JUST THE IDEA THAT WE HAD
BUT THERE'S KINDA IT WAS KINDA LIKE OKAY I DON'T REALLY THINK I DUNNO WHAT I'M DOING HERE
SO I DIDN'T REALLY THINK IT WAS HELPFUL
MM
YEAH
YEAH
I NEVER USE IT
YEAH
YEAH BUT UH
I CAN'T SAY I FOUND EVERYTHING PARTICULARLY HELPFUL
LIKE I
IT DIDN'T REALLY YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
MY FIRST BIT OF INFORMATION WAS LIKE THIS CHILD'S DRAWN PICTURE OF HOW A REMOTE WORKS
IT
I THOUGH IT WAS BRILLIANT NO
REALLY
I THINK IT DEPENDS ON THE ROLE NO
NO MINE WAS REALLY HELPFUL AS IN MY STUFF WAS QUITE HELPFUL I THINK
YEAH IT PROBABLY DOES
SO LIKE A F
'CAUSE I
I MEAN M MY PROBLEM YEAH YEAH
SEE I COULDN'T DO THAT SO I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT YOU GUYS WERE DOING
AND WHEN YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT IT I WAS JUST LIKE YOU KNOW THAT'S WH THAT'S WHY I SEEMED SO IGNORANT WHEN WHEN YOU WERE J EXPLAINING THINGS
'CAUSE MY PROBLEM WAS YOU GUYS HAD ACCESS TO LIKE THEY'D PUT SEND YOU TO SITES AND STUFF RIGHT
YEAH I THINK SO
YEAH
AS IF YOU'D WANTED TO
YEAH WELL MINE WAS MOSTLY MADE UP EXCEPT WHEN THEY TOLD ME LIKE YOU KNOW TITANIUM COSTS MORE THAN WOOD TO MAKE A REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH
BUT IT MUST HAVE BEEN QUITE DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO BUILD A WHOLE UM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
SYSTEM
A WHOLE SYSTEM 'CAUSE OF COURSE THEY CAN'T GIVE YOU UH UH ANYTHING COMPARABLE TO THE INTERNET FOR THE
YEAH I MEAN IT
YEAH
LIKE I HAD THE STUFF ABOUT HOW ME HOW RUBBER'S CHEAP AND YOU HAVE HOW PEOPLE WANT IT TO BE SPONGY AND
WELL I THINK IT'S INTERESTING HOW IT ALL WENT TOGETHER
YEAH YEAH
YEAH HUH
IT SEEMS PLANNED YOU KNOW
YEAH
BUT UM
YEAH I KINDA THOUGHT THAT UM I FELT LIKE I WOULD GO AND LIKE TRY TO USE MY INFORMATION
OR LIKE I'D MAKE THIS STUPID LITTLE PRESENTATION AND THEN LIKE I JUST WOULD END UP TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING COMPLETELY UNRELATED BECAUSE I DUNNO I FELT LIKE I WAS OFF TASK ALL THE TIME
YEAH
SO IT'S
WELL I MEAN WE REALLY GOT INTO TALKING ABOUT LIKE PERSONAL PRACTICALIT LIKE IT WASN'T NECESSARILY WHAT WAS LIKE WE WOULD NEVER HAVE THOUGHT OF FRUIT OR SPONGINESS YOU KNOW
YEAH
IF I HADN'T BEEN TOLD THAT FRUIT WAS
NO
YEAH
BUT I THINK THAT IT IT MIGHT BE TO SEE WHETHER PEOPLE ACTUALLY ALL COME UP WITH THE SAME THING
OH RIGHT
GIVEN CERTAIN INFORMATION OR
LOOKS LIKE OH NO THAT'S NOT UM
YEAH LIKE IF EVERYONE'S GIVEN THE SAME INPUT I DON'T HAVE A CLUE ANYWAY
UM WHAT'S NEXT
JUST YEAH
MM MM
IT'S QUITE
WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK OF THE PENS
IT ASKS ABOUT THAT
THEY'RE KINDA HARD TO WRITE WITH THOUGH
THEY'RE PRETTY COOL
MM
I WANNA S
YEAH AND I I'VE F FORGOTTEN ONCE OR TWICE TO CHECK THE BOX
YEAH
I I'D LIKE TO SEE WHAT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE ON THE
THEY'RE NICER THAN THE PEN THAT I'M USING BECAUSE LIKE YOUR STUFF ACTUALLY SHOWS UP HERE RATHER THAN HAVING TO LOOK AT THE SCREEN AND WRITE
MM
BUT EVEN SO I DUNNO
AND NEW IDEAS FOUND
YEAH
YEAH IT'S ALL VERY NEW NO
IT'S ALL VERY NEW
YEAH I THINK I'D LIKE TO UM
I DUNNO
LIKE IT WAS THE I THINK THE MICROPHONES ARE OKAY WHEN YOU'RE SITTING DOWN
BUT LIKE THEY'RE KINDA CLUMSY I GUESS WHEN YOU'RE LIKE WHEN YOU'RE S GOING UP TO THE WHITEBOARD LIKE
SORRY
OH YEAH
WELL THEY DROP OFF IF YOU LIKE MOVE TOO MUCH
BUT THEY'RE THEY'RE OKAY
YEAH I DUNNO
I DON'T KNOW
MAYBE WE ARE
BUT I DON'T THINK WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE TESTING THESE MICROPHONES
UH I THINK AND I THINK THAT UH
MM
OR LIKE I DUNNO
ALL THIS TECHNOLOGY LIKE I GUESS SOME PEOPLE MUST BE INTERESTED IN USING IT BUT I CAN'T IMAGINE FINDING IT ANY MORE USEFUL THAN LIKE LOOKING AT SOMEONE'S NOTES
YEAH
THERE'S JUST THERE'S REALLY NOT THAT MUCH INFORMATION THAT ACTUALLY GOES THROUGH A REAL MEETING LIKE WHEN YOU'RE ACTUALLY AT A REAL MEETING IN A REAL COMPANY
WELL THE THING IS LIKE I ACTUALLY WORKED IN A COMPANY AND I HAD A ROLE AND I HAD TO GO TO MEETINGS
AND YOU'RE SORT OF GOING OVER GENERAL STUFF THAT ANYBODY WHO'S SORT OF ON TASK SHOULD ALREADY KNOW
IT'S LIKE THE THERE'S JUST REALLY NOT A LOT OF INFORMATION THAT GOES THROUGH
LIKE USUALLY I MISSED MEETINGS DELIBERATELY
IT'S MOSTLY LIKE REHASHING OLD STUFF
AND LIKE THE LAST THING I WOULD HAVE WANTED WOULD BE TO HAVE TO WATCH A VIDEO 'CAUSE I MISSED A MEETING
YEAH
HM
YEAH
YEAH
SEEMS KIND OF LIKE AN EXCESSIVE REITERATION
IT SEEMS LIKE WAY OVERKILL
I WOULDN'T NEED TO HAVE TO WATCH LIKE A T TWO HOUR VIDEO WITH THE SOUND AND THE TRANSCRIPT AND
LIKE IF I MISSED A MEETING I COULD PROBABLY GET IT SUMMED UP IN LIKE ONE SENTENCE
YEAH
YEAH
I GUESS IT WOULD BE
IT'S GOTTA BE WORTH IT TO I 'CAUSE I'M JUST MOSTLY CURIOUS ABOUT LIKE WHAT KIND OF PERSON OR LIKE COMPANY WOULD WOULD REALLY FIND IT USEFUL 'CAUSE
CAN'T REALLY IMAGINE DUNNO
HOW ABOUT A P A
UM I DUNNO
WELL DOES ANYONE WANNA TALK ABOUT FRUIT MORE WHILE WE STILL HAVE TIME
ANY OTHER IDEAS FOR
WHAT WHAT'S THE END
OR WE ENDING
ARE WE ARE WE SUPPOSED TO UM YOU SUPPOSED TO WRITE A REPORT
IS THAT THE END
UM WE STILL HAVE TIME IF THERE'S ANY OTHER INPUT
I MEAN THE I THINK WE DID REALLY WELL PERSONALLY WHICH IS WHY WE'VE
YOU KNOW GONE THROUGH THIS SO QUICKLY
'CAUSE I MEAN WE'VE ALL WE ALL KIND OF AGREED OUR PRODUCT IS SATISFACTORY IT FITS THE BUDGET AND IT'S TRENDY
SO
YEAH
UM
YOU HAVE TO TELL HER SHE
END OF MEETING
SO I THINK THAT'S ALL FOR TODAY
OKAY WE HAVE TO FILL IN ALL THIS STUFF
STUFF STUFF STUFF
M MEETING ADJOURNED
MEETING ADJOURNED
YEAH
I THINK I'VE LEARNED NOT TO BRING PLAY DOUGH TO MEETINGS
YEAH
I THINK IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA I LIKE IT
IT'S HARD ENOUGH TO GET PEOPLE ACTUALLY PAYING ATTENTION
ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE FOOD
SO I GUESS WE'RE SUPPOSED TO WRITE FINAL REPORTS
'CAUSE
ALL OF US

WE'LL HAVE TO SEE ON A THROUGH DISCUSSION ON WHERE WE'RE GONNA GO FROM HERE AND FROM WITH THIS
MM-HMM BUT UH DO YOU ALREADY HAVE LIKE A FUNCTIONAL DESIGN OR A TECHNICAL DESIGN OR
UH FOR THE MOMENT NOT YET
OH FOR THE MOMENT NOT YET OKAY BUT UH WHAT'S WHAT'S YOUR UH DO YOU HAVE SOME PROJECT PLAN SOMETHING WITH YOU OR

WHAT IS THE GOAL OF THE PROJECT
UH THE GOAL OF THE PROJECT I THINK MAYBE I'LL UH HAND OUT TO THE ED OKAY
SO TO EXPLAIN UH WHAT IS THE PROJECT BECAUSE HE'S IN THE SALES AND THE ACCOUNTING
I'M IN THE SALES I'M SUPPOSED TO EXPLAIN THEM WHAT TO DO
WE HAVE TO DEFINE EXACTLY WHAT OUR PRODUCT IS FROM UH
YES SO CAN YOU EXPLAIN UH WHAT EXACTLY THE PRODUCT IS
FROM WHAT I HAD IN MIND WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE MARKETING COFFEE IS THAT RIGHT
OH I THINK UH IF I'M NOT WRONG WE'RE MAKING THE REMOTE CONTROL
UM I WAS WONDERING
I HAD A FIRST PART OF MINE WAS TO MAKE A REMOTE CONTROL FOR A NEW F REMOTE CONTROL FOR TELEVISION
AND AFTERWARD I HAD A DISCUSSION ABOUT COFFEE SO WE'LL START WITH THE REMOTE CONTROL FOR TELEVISION THEN
REMOTE CONTROLS 'CAUSE I HAD TWO DIFFERENT THINGS
YES
SO WE'RE HAVE TO DESIGN SOMETHING THAT IS VERY USER FRIENDLY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
SOMETHING UH VISUAL THAT HAS SOMETHING THAT WILL WILL DRAW PEOPLE TO BUY THE PRODUCT
BECAUSE I THINK EVERYBODY'S EXPERIENCED WITH UH REMOTE CONTROLS AND SOME REMOTE CONTROLS ARE ARE WORTH UH THROWING OUT THE WINDOW
MM-HMM
'CAUSE A LOT OF TIMES UH SPEND UH HALF A DAY THROUGH THE INSTRUCTION BOOK TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE IT
UH TH MOST OF THEM AR I DON'T KNOW WE'RE HAVE TO COME UP WITH A NEW IDEA ON HOW TO MAKE IT A LOT EASIER TO USE
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM
AND UH WHAT ABO UH CHRISTINE WHAT ABOUT YOUR UH THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGN PLAN
ARE YOU HAVE A DESIGN ALREADY ON THIS PRODUCT OR UH YOU'RE STILL WORKING ON THE DESIGN
UM THE WEBSITE I WENT TO LOOK AT HAD SOME ANNOUNCEMENTS ABOUT AN INTRODUCTION OF A UM UH SOME SORT OF A SEVEN INCH UM MONITOR
AND UM I UH I ACTUALLY DIDN'T KNOW WE WERE DESIGNING A REMOTE CONTROL I THOUGHT WE WERE DESIGNING A NEW MONITOR
AND UM I UNDERSTOOD THAT THAT WAS THE PROJECT GOAL
UM NO I I HAVE NOT BEGUN WORKING ON THE DESIGN
MM-HMM
SO UM I'M GLAD I DIDN'T D DO ANY WORK UM AHEAD OF TIME BECAUSE UH I CLEARLY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE PROJECT GOAL
OKAY
AND UM THAT'S ABOUT UH THAT'S AND I I READ THROUGH THE DIFFERENT STEPS AND WHAT MY RESPONSIBILITIES WERE RELATIVE TO THE STEPS
UM I JUST DID S SEE THAT WE WERE STARTING A NEW PROJECT TOGETHER AND THERE WAS GOING TO BE A FOUR MEMBER TEAM COMPOSED OF THESE PEOPLE
MM-HMM
SO UH YOU'LL BE LEADING THE TEAM FOR YOUR DESIGN TEAM OR HOW MANY MEMBERS IS WORKING IN THE TEAM FOR THE DESIGN
UH FOR THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGN
YES
UM WELL I WOULD TH THINK THAT DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH MONEY YOU GIVE US
OKAY
THAT'S
UM BECAUSE UH YOU KNOW YOU CAN UH YOU CAN MAKE IT UH YOU HAVE DIFFERENT CHOICES WITH DIFFERENT FINANCIAL MODELS
UH DO YOU HAVE SOME IDEA HOW WE CAN UH SELL THIS PRODUCT OR PROJECT IN THE MARKET AND HOW MUCH IS GOING TO BENEFIT TO THE COMPANY AND UH OF COURSE IT'S TO THE INDIVIDUAL ALSO
YEAH BUT UH BEFORE WE TALK ABOUT UH THE FINANCE OKAY
THAT'S UH VERY ATTRACTIVE THAT UM PEOPLE SEE AND RECOGNIZE UH ITS GOAL AND UH THEY IMMEDIATELY WANNA HAVE IT UH HAVE ONE OF THEIR OWN
SO IT WOULD REALLY WOULD NEED TO UM SOMETHING LIKE THE IPOD WOULD BE GOOD
SEEMS TO HAVE CAUGHT ON FAIRLY WELL SO UM D UH YOU KNOW I DON'T CARE WHAT IT DOES JUST SO IT LOOKS COOL
WELL YOU KNOW UM I KIND OF THINK THAT IN GENERAL YOU HAVE TO DO UH UM Y YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S VERY FASHIONABLE
MM-HMM
OKAY BUT UH UH WHEN YOU THINK YOU CAN GIVE ME LIKE A KIND OF DESIGN ON THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN OR THE TECHNICAL DESIGN
IF THEY UH GO QUICKLY THEN UH IT COULD BE A MONTH
WELL UH I'VE GOT A LOT OF OTHER PROJECTS I'M DOING RIGHT NOW UM AND SO I'LL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE HOW THOSE UH HOW THOSE GO
IF UM IF I RUN INTO ANY PROBLEMS IN MY OTHER PROJECTS IT MIGHT BE SIX MONTHS
AND UH HOW MANY PEOPLE YOU NEED FOR THIS PROJECT AND WHAT'S THE TIME FRAME YOU'RE LOOKING
OKAY AND WHAT IS THE BUDGET MAYBE UH INITIAL BUDGET YOU'RE LOOKING
YEAH BUT UH I NEED SOMETHING IN THE WRITING SO LIKE UH WHAT'S YOUR FUNCTIONAL DESIGN WHAT'S YOUR TECHNICAL DESIGN
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
SO YOU'VE YOU'VE HAD TO MEET WITH THE MARKETING TEAM AND HOW THEY'RE GOING TO MARKET AND WHAT ARE THE MARKETING STRATEGIC PLAN
OKAY AND UH HOW IS GOING TO THE MARKET OKAY
OKAY WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO INTRODUCE OKAY AND BY THE TIME YOU INTRODUCE THE PRODUCT AND UH YOU KNOW THERE THERE WOULD BE A COMPETITION
OKAY SO I NEED SOME KIND OF UH UH THE PLAN IN THE WRITING FROM YOU
AND WHEN WOULD YOU LIKE THAT
OKAY AND IT'S PO
B AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
UH WELL IF UH IF WE HAVE ENOUGH TIME UH THEN D DO YOU THINK UM TWO WEEKS IS A IS CLOSE ENOUGH
I CANNOT GO TO THE MANAGEMENT AND SAY SO WE ARE GOING TO DO THIS AND WE NEED THIS MUCH MONEY
AND UH WHAT COST IS OKAY
AND WHAT'S THE TIME FRAME AND WHAT'S THE PROJECT PLAN BECAUSE UH WITHOUT ANY UH DOCUMENTATIONS
YES I THINK UH THAT WOULD BE GOOD BECAUSE I NEED TO GO TO THE MANAGEMENT AND UH TELL THEM WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO
OKAY SO THEN IT'S IT'S DIFFICULT FOR ME TO SAY OKAY
THAT'S THE REASON I NEED UH SOME KIND OF PLAN FROM YOU INITIALLY OKAY THEN WE CAN HAVE THE FURTHER DISCUSSION AGAIN
UH ARE THERE OTHER PEOPLE WHO WILL BE CONTRIBUTING TO THE PLAN
YES OF COURSE IF YOU NEED SOME HELP UH SO LET ME KNOW
TO ADD IN ANY DOCUMENTATION OR SOME TECHNICAL POINT OF VIEW SO JUST LET ME KNOW SO I CAN UH COORDINATE ALL THE TEAMS
SO WHO ARE THE PEOPLE YOU NEED UH FROM THE MARKETING OR UH THE TECHNICAL SIDE OR UH THE ADMINISTRATION POINT OF VIEW OKAY
OKAY I'LL GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT
YES
THANK YOU
OKAY
AND UH ED UH SO WHAT'S WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT UH THIS UH PROJECT FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL AND D DO YOU HAVE SOME ALREADY PLANNED SOMETHING FOR YOUR MARKETING STRATEGY OR UH THE SALES STRATEGY
IT SHOULD BE A FAIRLY LARGE MARKET BECAUSE UH THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT UH THE COMPETITION
UH TH I AGREE IT HAS TO BE SOMETHING IT HAS TO BE SOMETHING NEW
IT HAS TO BE SOMETHING THAT THAT DRAWS PEOPLE SAYING EH I LIKE THIS
WELL NOT YET OTHER THAN UH DOING RESEARCH AND TAKING REMOTE CONTROLS AND LOOKING WHAT OTHER COMPANIES HAVE TO DO UH
WHAT THEY'RE BUILDING THEIR DESIGNS THEIR IDEAS UH ALSO HAVE TO PINPOINT WHICH MARKET WE'RE GONNA GO INTO
HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
WHETHER IT WORKS OR NOT THEY HAVE TO FIRST SAY I LIKE THIS I LIKE THE DESIGN AND THEN IT'S GOTTA BE SIMPLE TO USE
YES SO WHAT I UH PREFER MAYBE UH YOU NEED TO INTERACT UH MORE WITH THE CHRISTINE
OKAY BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT SHE IS GOING TO DO IT OKAY AND YOU KNOW HOW TO SELL IT
OKAY BECAUSE UH SHE IS DOING THE DESIGN BUT YOU ARE THE CORE BECAUSE YOU ARE IN THE MARKETING OKAY
SO BECAUSE YOU NEED TO SELL AND YOU'RE THE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ALL THE MONEY THE FINANCE OKAY TOMORROW
YEAH
MM-HMM
OKAY WHO IS USING THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN OR TECHNICAL DESIGN
SO WHAT I PREFER OKAY SO YOU NEED TO INTERACT WITH THE CHRISTINE MORE AND UH WITHIN HER TEAM
OKAY HOW WE ARE GOING TO DO THE YOUR SALES PLAN OKAY TH
OKAY AND UH YOU NEED TO COME UP WITH SOME KIND OF PLAN
MM-HMM
HOW MUCH IT'S GONNA SELL FOR THAT'S UP THAT'S UP TO US TO DECIDE EH
DO WE ALREADY HAVE A COST LIMIT ON THIS TH AN IDEA OF HOW MUCH UH WE WANT TO MARKET THIS FOR
TH
THAT THAT'S
AND COME UP WITH THE COST AND HOW WE ARE GOING TO COMPETE IN THE MARKET OKAY
YES THAT'S YOU HAVE TO DECIDE OKAY SO THE BEST THING IS YOU UH BOTH OF UH THE CHRISTINE AND YOU DISCUSS WITH YOURSELF OKAY
IN THE THE TECHNICALLY OR IN THE SALES WISE OKAY THE COMMERCIAL WISE OKAY
OKAY HOW MUCH IS GOING TO COST US AND HOW MUCH WE ARE GOING TO BENEFIT FOR THE COMPANY
THEN UH WE HAVE TO DESIGN OKAY HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE THE WHOLE PROJECT
OKAY OF COURSE IT'S IT'S UH OF BENEFIT FOR EVERYBODY INDIVIDUALLY
OKAY SO I THINK IT'S UH MAYBE IF WE CAN UH GIVE ME SOME KIND OF YOUR UH THE SALES PLAN
OKAY THEN IT WILL HELP ME TO DISCUSS WITH THE MANAGEMENT FOR FURTHER OKAY AND PUT IT IN THE THE PROPER PROJECT PLAN
OKAY INCLUDING THE TECHNICAL WHAT UH SHE'S GOING TO TALK TO YOU WITHIN THE TEAM
VERY GOOD
OKAY AND IF YOU NEED UH ANY COORDINATION IN BETWEEN UH COMPARED TO THE MAYBE THE SOME TECHNICAL VENDORS OR COMMERCIAL VENDORS
OKAY DEPENDS IF YOU WANT TO HAVE SOME UH UH MARKETING PLAN OR TECHNICAL PLAN OKAY SO YOU LET ME KNOW
OKAY I CAN COORDINATE OR MAYBE UH YOU ARE MY COORDINATOR AM I RIGHT
VERY GOOD
MM
BETWEEN UH ALL THE COOR
IT'S ACCEPTABLE TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GONNA USE IT AND LOOK AT THE BEST WAYS TO DO THAT
WELL NO NOT EXACTLY
I MEAN MY JOB FROM WHAT I UNDERSTOOD WAS TO LOOK AT THE USABILITY REQUIREMENTS AND MAKE SURE THAT THE PRODUCT IS USABLE
YEAH
SO THAT SHE'S NOT DESIGNING SOMETHING THAT MY STUDIES WILL SHOW RIGHT OFF THE BAT THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK
AND SO IT'S SORT OF IT'S A LOOP THAT FEEDS IN BUT I DON'T THINK NECESSARILY THAT I'M IN A COORDINATING POSITION FOR IT
SO I THINK I'LL HAVE TO INTERACT WITH CHRISTINE AND DISCUSS WITH HER
TH CHRISTINE YEAH
WHICH IS
YES
YEAH SO BASICALLY YOU NEED TO INTERACT WITH CHRISTINE MORE OKAY FOR THE USER ACCEPTABILITY OKAY AND THE TESTING OKAY THEN YOU WILL
YEAH
WHAT TAG LINES YOU ATTACH TO IT HOW YOU TRY TO MAKE IT MORE ATTRACTIVE TO USERS
WHICH WILL ALSO FEED INTO THE MARKETING BECAUSE DEPENDING ON WHAT USERS WANT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU SELL IT
SO I THINK ALL THREE GROUPS WILL NEED TO INTERACT QUITE A BIT
MM-HMM
YES
YES
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
UM AND THEN I GUESS BUILD THE PLAN BASED ON ALL OF THAT BECAUSE I THINK YOU NEED TO TAKE ALL THE FACTORS INTO ACCOUNT
YEP

YEP
OKAY WELCOME BACK
I HOPE UH YOU HAVE A FRESH HEAD AND A FRESH TIME
HOW T NOW THE MEETING ACTUALLY WE GATHERING HERE TO DISCUSS ABOUT THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN MEETING
OKAY AND UH WE'LL ISSUE SOME INFORMATION FROM UH ALL OF YOU
AND IT'S IN THE I THINK UH IN THE SHARING FOLDER
AND UH I WILL INVITE UH THE CHRISTINE AND THE ED AND UH AGNES TO DISCUSS ABOUT ON THE VARIOUS SUBJECTS
SO CAN YOU GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE
YEAH UH THE AGENDA OF THE MEETING IS OPENING
WHAT I'M GOING TO DO AND UH OF COURSE I'M DOING THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND SECRETARY BOTH
THEN UH I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT UH THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT
OKAY TO TAKE THE MINUTES OF THE MEETING
AND THERE ARE THREE PRESENTATIONS
ONE IS UH NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENTS
AND THE SECOND ONE ABOUT UH DECISION ON REMOTE CONTROL FUNCTIONS
AND UH FINALLY WE ARE CLOSING
UH AND THE MEETING TIME WILL BE UH FORTY MINUTES SO YOU HAVE TO BE VERY QUICK
AND I HAVE COME UP WITH THE MANAGEMENT COME WITH THE NEW PROPOSAL OKAY AND I HAVE TO DISCUSS A FEW POINTS ON THIS
UH BOTH SAYS NEW INSIGHTS IN THE AIM OF YOUR PROJECT
UH THE ONE IS UH THE TELETEXT BECOMES UH OUTMODED OKAY BECAUSE IF UH BECAUSE OF THE COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND THE NEW TECHNOLOGY
SO WE DON'T NEED TO CONSIDER REALLY ABOUT THE TELETEXT ALL IN OUR NEW PROJECT DESIGN
AND THE SECOND ONE IS ABOUT UH THE REMOTE CONTROL
SHOULD BE USED ONLY FOR THE T. V.
THAT'S WHAT OUR UH MANAGEMENT SAYS
AND THE THIRD POINT IT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT TO ESTABLISH OUR UH MARKETING OR UH CORPORATE IMAGE OKAY WITH THIS NEW PROJECT OR NEW PRODUCT
OKAY
SO I WILL INVITE UH
AGNES CAN YOU GO TO THE THIRD SLIDE
NO THIS IS THE THIRD SLIDE
OKAY
SO I'LL INVITE UH CHRISTINE TO DISCUSS ABOUT UH THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN
'KAY DO YOU WANNA OPEN THE
SURE
UM
YOU'RE PARTICIPANT S
I'M NUMBER TWO
TWO
THAT'S IT
DO YOU WANT THE MOUSE OR DO YOU WANT ME TO
YEAH THANKS
I'LL DO THE NOTES
SO UM WELL I I FIGURED UH WE SHOULD UM IDENTIFY SOME USER REQUIREMENTS AND FROM MY EXPERIENCE I WANNA UH
REALLY HAVE
YOU CAN'T UH CAN'T HAVE LIKE UH WAFFLING ON THIS POINT YOU KNOW
AND FROM RESEARCH I DID UH THE THE DEVICE HAS TO TURN THE TELEVISION ON AND OFF THE FIRST TIME YOU PRESS ON THE BIG BUTTON
IT NEEDS TO BE ABLE Y Y HAVE TO BE ABLE TO FIND IT
BECAUSE ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS WITH REMOTE CONTROLS IS FINDING THEM
SO UH I ALSO SINCE WE HAVE TO ESTABLISH OUR CORPORATE IMAGE ON THE BASIS OF THIS NEW PRODUCT
THOUGHT WE BETTER LOOK AT THINGS THAT ARE POPULAR AND UM EX GO BEYOND THOSE AND AS I SAID IN THE FIRST MEETING
ESPECIALLY IN THE THE UH THE OUTSIDE OF THE PRODUCT SO THAT IT GIVES THE APPEARANCE AND IT IS RELIABLE AND SO FORTH
UM AND THEN UH WE MIGHT WANNA TALK EVENTUALLY ABOUT THE MATERIALS THAT ARE APPROPRIATE TO USE IN UH IN THE CONSTRUCTION
'CAUSE IT MADE ME THINK OF UM UM MAYBE THE REMOTE CONTROL MADE A BIG FLASH WHEN UH YOU TURN THE T. V. ON AND OFF THAT MIGHT BE INTERESTING
SO I GUESS THIS GUY ZENITH UH CREATED THE FLASHMATIC
I DID A LITTLE HISTORY ON UH THE THE UH REMOTE CONTROLS AND WHEN THEY WERE INVENTED AND SO FORTH
WHICH I KINDA LIKE THE IDEA
AND UM SO IT WAS HIGHLY DIRECTIONAL FLASH LIGHT THAT UH YOU COULD TURN THE PICTURE ON AND OFF
AND THE SOUND ON AND OFF AND CHANGE CHANNELS C SO I THINK UM THOSE ARE STILL REQUIREMENTS WE HAVE TODAY UH FIFTY YEARS LATER
MM-HMM
SO THAT UH IT WOULD GET WOULD START OFF BY THE YOU'D GET IT WOULD EASILY CAUSE UM PROBLEMS
AND UH IT WAS REALLY A PIONEERING INNOVATION BUT IT WAS UH SENSITIVE TO THE SUN
SO UH
I IN ADDITION TO UH LOOKING AT THE UM UH THE FUNCTIONAL REQUIR SO ALL THESE DEVICES ARE EXAMPLES OF WHERE UH MM THEY REPRESENT EXAMPLES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TODAY
WHICH I THINK THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE
IS R UM REALLY UH SOMETHING TO KEEP IN MIND
IT'D BE EASY TO FIND
FANTASTIC
AND UM IT WOULD UH Y YOU'D YOU COULD THROW IT AT THINGS IF IF THE T. V. DIDN'T TURN ON AND OFF YOU COULD USE IT FOR SOMETHING ELSE
AND SINCE I'M NOT REALLY UM INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THIS SLIDE
BUT UM
I DON'T KNOW WHY UM WE WERE ASKED TO DO THIS
I JUST TOOK SOME DIFFERENT UH SCHEMATICS AND I PUT THEM INTO THIS
AND I GUESS THIS IS WHAT A SLIDE MIGHT LOOK LIKE IF YOU WERE DRAWING A CIRCUIT BOARD
SO
UH PERSONAL PREFERENCES UM
AND I THINK THAT WE SHOULD CONSIDER PERHAPS HAVING AN AN AN A A SIZE UH A REMOTE CONTROL THAT CHANGES IN SIZE DEPENDING ON THE USER PREFERENCE
I THINK WE COULD UH I I'M REALLY THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX HERE
SO SOMETHING THAT'S VERY VERY FLEXIBLE AND INFLATABLE AND THEN YOU COULD SHRINK IT
OR YOU COULD MAKE IT CLEAR AND UM KIND OF BLEND IN WITH THINGS
SO YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO UM UH HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE TH THE DECORATION OF THE OF THE USER'S HOME
I THINK UM IT COULD EITHER BE YOU COULD GO EITHER ONE EXTREME BE VERY COLOURFUL
BECAUSE UH SOMETIMES THEY FALL INTO CUPS AND YOU KNOW IT MIGHT BE OUT BY THE SWIMMING POOL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
UM I THINK UH IT NEEDS TO BE WATERPROOF
I KEEP PUSHING ON THE REMOTE CONTROL AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S ACTUALLY UNDERSTOOD MY MESSAGE
SO I THINK IT SHOULD GIVE YOU SOME SORT OF AN ORAL CUE
UM IF YOU UH MI ONE OF ONE OF MY REQUIREMENTS WAS ABOUT NEEDS T TO TELL YOU WHEN IT'S DONE ITS JOB OR NOT BECAUSE HALF THE TIME
AND UH COURSE I NEVER WANNA REPLACE THE BATTERY
SO THAT'S THOSE ARE MY F PREFERENCES AND THAT'S MY PRESENTATION
YEAH LET ME UH INTERRUPT YOU UH
IF YOU CAN ADD OTHER FACILITY OTHER FEATURE LIKE UH UNBREAKABLE
YES
OKAY AND THE KIDS THROW IT AND THEY THEY PLAY WITH THEIR REMOTES AND
OKAY BECAUSE UH ESPECIALLY TODAY YOU KNOW YOU HAVE THE FAMILY AND THE KIDS
RUN OVER IT WITH A CAR
YES
OKAY SO IF YOU CAN ADD THE FEATURE OKAY FOR YOUR UH FABRIC WHATEVER IN YOUR OUTLINE DESIGN
OKAY WITH UNBREAKABLE OKAY I THINK THAT WILL GIVE A LOT OF ADVANTAGE FOR OUR PRODUCT
GOOD IDEA I'LL I'LL UH UM
GOOD IDEA
IF I'M NOT WRONG
MAYBE YOU CAN UH ADD IT IN THAT
YES VERY GOOD
OKAY UH THANK YOU CHRISTINE AND UH UH ANY QUESTIONS OR UH CLARIFICATIONS OR ANY DISCUSSION ON THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN
DO YOU HAVE ANY PRECONCEIVED IDEAS IN TERMS OF MATERIALS
'CAUSE FOR EXAMPLE IN THE UNBREAKABLE THING DOING SOMETHING PLASTIC WOULD BE HARDER WHEREAS HAVING SOMETHING LIKE
I DUNNO STEEL OR TITANIUM ISN'T REALLY ECONOMICALLY VIABLE
HMM
TITANIUM
TITANIUM WOULD BE BE HEAVY TOO WOULDN'T IT
TITANIUM
YEAH
NO I HAVEN'T REALLY UM I WANTED FEEDBACK I THINK WE NEED TO RATE RANK THESE
BUT WE'LL SEE WHAT YOUR UH PERSONAL PREFERENCES ARE AND YOUR THOUGHTS
YEAH
NO I JUST WONDERING WHETHER THAT YOU HAD ANY SORT OF
SURE YEAH
IT'S LIGHT
I LIKE TITANIUM
YEAH
EXPENSIVE
UH YEAH BUT UH WHO WHO SAID WHO SAID WE WERE YOU KNOW NOBODY TOLD ME HOW MU WHAT OUR FINANCIAL OBJECTIVE IS SO UM
THE MARKETING COMES OUT
YES
YEAH SO
IT'D BE HARD TO INFLATE SOMETHING OU MADE OUT OF TITANIUM THOUGH
YEAH THE THE I'M SORRY BECAUSE UH THE LAST MEETING WE SUPPOSED TO DISCUSS ABOUT THE FINANCIAL THING
UH LET ME GO QUICKLY MAYBE IF I CAN GO BACK
I KNOW THE PROJECT PLAN AND THE BUDGET
SO I CAN CLOSE THIS NOT SURE
WAS IN UH
S
THIS
SO LET ME SEE WHERE IS THIS FILE
THAT'S CHRISTINE'S
THIS IS CHRISTINE
AND THAT'S MINE I THINK
THAT'S YOURS OKAY
SAVING
IN MODIFIED
I DON'T KNOW I THINK VERBALLY WE CAN WE CAN PRETTY MUCH SELL
OKAY UH I WILL I WILL SEND YOU A MAIL OKAY
THE PROJECT MAY BE THE THE PROJECT AIM OKAY
AT THE END OF THE DAY THE COMPANY UH WANTS TO MAKE AT LEAST UH THE FIFTY MILLION EURO
OKAY AND UH OF COURSE THE PRICE WILL BE VERY REASONABLE ON THE THE SALES SIDE
OKAY
THAT MAYBE EDDIE WILL TALK TO YOU ABOUT UH HOW MUCH UH THE PRICE AND UH WHAT'S UH HOW MUCH ITS COST FOR THE MANUFACTURING AND HOW MUCH IT'S GOING TO BE WE SELL IN THE MARKET
OKAY
THEN UH YOU CAN COME BACK WITH YOUR FEEDBACK
THIS REMOTE CONTROL OKAY IT CAN BE FOR LIKE UNIVERSAL TO USE FOR ANY T. V.
AND I I HAVE ONE MAYBE THE SUGGESTION OR OPINION
OKAY AND IT WILL BE SLIM OKAY AND UH
NOT FAT
NOT FAT
NOT FAT HUH
OKAY
MIGHT BE HARD TO FIND THOUGH
YEP
HMM
BUT LET'S TRY IT OKAY WITH THE DIFFERENT UH THE DESIGNS OKAY THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGNS
OH OKAY
OKAY
SO ANY OTHER QUESTIONS
UH FROM HER SIDE I DON'T THINK UH THERE'S TOO MANY MORE QUESTIONS
IF YOU CAN COME TO THE
OKAY
THANK YOU CHRISTINE FOR UH TIME BEING SO THEN UH
ED SO CAN YOU TELL ABOUT
I WAS LOOKING FOR A A REMOTE CONTROL TO HAVE A S
OKAY FROM THE MARKETING YEAH FROM THE MARKETING SIDE JUST TO TO GIVE AN IDEA WHAT THE MANAGEMENT IS LOOKING FOR
S 'SCUSE ME FOR ONE SEC
I HAVE A SALES PRICE OF TWENTY FIVE EURO WITH A PRODUCTION PRICE OF UH TWELVE AND A HALF EURO
FOR WHAT UH I THINK FROM WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIND WE'RE TR WE'RE LOOKING FOR I DON'T THINK THAT PRICE IS EXACTLY IN THE MARKET
OKAY
MM-HMM
I'LL EXPLAIN MYSELF HERE NOW IN THE SENSE THAT UH
IN A IN THE RECENT SURVEYS UH FROM THE AGES FR FROM FIFTEEN TO THIRTY FIVE
EIGHTY PERCENT ARE WILLING TO SPEND MORE MONEY FOR SOMETHING AS FANCY AS TRENDY
THAT'S A MARKET PRICE RIGHT NOW
TWENTY FIVE EUROS UH THAT'S THAT'S A PRESON REASONABLE PRICE
BUT GIVE THEM ADDED THINGS THAT THEY DON'T HAVE NOW THEN IT W IT COULD POSSIBLY SELL
OBVIOUSLY THE RISK IS THERE
NOW IF WE'RE GONNA TAKE A RISK AND PUSH THIS UP A BIT MAKE IT MORE EXPENSIVE
YEP
YEP
TOO EXPENSIVE THEY'RE NOT GONNA BUY
WHICH ALWAYS SPENDS MORE MONEY ON TRENDY NEW THINGS SPEECH RECOGNITION IS REQUESTED
BUT I THINK UH THERE'S ONE OTHER THING INTERESTING TWO THINGS THAT ARE INTERESTING IS THAT UH FROM THE FIFTEEN TO THIRTY FIVE YEAR OLD GROUP
SPEECH RECOGNITION
AND WE'RE TALKING BETWEEN SEVENTY FIVE TO NINETY PERCENT OF THIS GROUP IS WILLING TO PAY FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION ON A REMOTE
MM-HMM
OBVIOUSLY WE CAN'T MAKE A REMOTE INTO A COMPUTER BUT MAYBE SIMPLE COMMANDS
I DUNNO LOUDER SOFTER ON OFF
THAT MIGHT BE A POSSIBILITY EVEN THOUGH IT COSTS MORE TO BE THE FIRST ON THE MARKET TO PRODUCE THIS
THIRTY FIVE PERCENT SAY THEY'RE TOO DIFFICULT TO USE
SO WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY OF MAKING IT UM MORE USER FRIENDLY
UH FIFTY PERCENT SAY THEY CAN'T FIND THE REMOTE HALF THE TIME
SO MAYBE ONE WORD SPEECH RECOGNITION COMMANDS SAY REMOTE AND THERE'S A BEEP BEEP BEEP
AND THEY CAN FIND IT THROUGH YOU KNOW TEN TONS OF NEWSPAPERS MAGAZINES WHATEVER YOU HAVE AT HOME
BUT IN THE COST THAT UH THE MANAGEMENT IS LOOKING FOR THAT'S NOT GONNA BE POSSIBLE
BUT IF IT'S TRENDY IF IT'S FANCY IT'S GOT SOME COLOUR TO IT IF IT'S VERY EASY EASY TO USE
I CAN FIND MY MY REMOTE WITHOUT SPENDING HALF A DAY LOOKING FOR IT AND GETTING ALL UPSET 'CAUSE I CAN'T TURN THE T. V. ON
IF IT'S GOT SIMPLE REMOTE SPEECH REMOTE UH CONTROL LIKE I SAID
LOUDER SOFTER CHANGE CHANNEL ON OFF REMOTE IT GOES BEEP BEEP
SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO LOOK AT IT IN A IN THIS GLOBAL IDEA WITH THE IDEAS OF THE INDUSTRIAL UH DESIGN
BUT PRICE OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT
YEP
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT UH THE DESIGN
DO YOU THINK YOU CAN MAKE IT OR UH
D UH I'M SORRY
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT UH THE DESIGN UH WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT OF THE SPEECH RECOGNITION
SPEECH RECOGNITION
WELL UH TRAINING IS ALWAYS AN ISSUE WITH UH COMMANDS
MM-HMM
SO UM MIGHT UH WE CAN PERHAPS UM DO IT IF THE USER IS WILLING TO SPEND SOME TIME IN THE TRAINING PROCESS
UH IT COULD REDUCE TH TH UH THE OVERALL UM COST
NOT SURE HOW
BUT UM ANYWAY UM I I THINK ALSO THAT UH THIS MIGHT IMPACT THE BATTERY LIFE
AND UM SO MAYBE WHAT WE'LL HAVE TO DO IS UM ADD SOMETHING WHERE YOU CAN UM RECHARGE IT WIRELESSLY
SO THAT UH Y YOU KNOW SEN SEND POWER TO IT
SO UH OR MAYBE UH SET IT OUT IN THE SUN AND IT UH YOU KNOW GETS UH FROM THE LIGHT
UM A A SOLAR CELL INSIDE THERE SO THAT UH YOU HAVE ENOUGH UH JUICE TO DO ALL THESE FANCY THINGS
HMM
IT SEEMS ALSO LIKE WITH THE SPEECH RECOGNITION YEAH IT'S A GREAT FEATURE
BUT IF YOU'RE WATCHING T. V. THERE'S A LOT OF AMBIENT SOUND AND IT'S WORDS
IT'S NOT JUST YOU KNOW NOISES LIKE SOMETHING HITTING
OTHERWISE YOU CAN SAY REMOTE
BUT IF SOMEONE ON THE SCREEN IS SAYING THE SAME THING ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU HAVE SOMEONE IN A MOVIE SAYING OFF AND YOUR SCREEN DIES
IT'S ACTUAL SPEECH SO THEN YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SPEECH RECOGNIZER IS GOOD ENOUGH TO FILTER OUT THE T. V. SPEECH AND THE THE USER'S SPEECH
OFF
BECAUSE THEY'VE TRIGGERED THE REMOTE CONTROL AND IT'S TURNED OFF YOUR T. V.
SO I THINK IF WE CAN FIND A SPEECH RECOGNIZER THAT CAN HANDLE THOSE TYPES OF PROBLEMS THEN YEAH IT'D BE A REALLY GOOD MARKETING GIMMICK
BUT I THINK WE SERIOUSLY NEED TO CONSIDER HOW THAT WOULD IMPACT
MM
THE SITUATION
VERY GOOD POINT
BECAUSE THA W WITH SPEECH RECOGNITION UH TH I'M NOT THAT GOOD AT THAT IDEA BUT TH
MM-HMM
IF IT'S A ONE WORD RECOGNITION 'CAUSE I KNOW WITH TELEPHONES AND CARS AND THINGS I'VE SEEN IN THE STATES
A FRIEND OF MINE SAYS CALL MOM AND IT CALLS UP MOM
YEAH
YEAH
'KAY THE RADIO CAN BE ON AND EVERYTHING
YEP
BECAUSE I THINK S WITH SPEECH RECOGNITION IF UH THE THE REMOTE OR LIKE THE TELEPHONE IT HAS A EXACT WORD THAT IT HAS TO HEAR
MM-HMM
I DON'T THINK IT WOULD COME THROUGH A SENTENCE IN A TELEVISION
IF SOMEBODY'S SPEAKING ON THE SE THE TELEVISION THEY'RE NOT GONNA STOP AND SAY REMOTE OKAY
MM-HMM
SO I THINK THAT UH SOMETHING COULD BE DESIGNED TO RECOGNISE SINGLE WORD
OH YEAH
YEAH
LIKE THE T LIKE THE TELEPHONE
NO I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA IF WE CAN DESIGN IT TO TO SUIT THOSE REQUIREMENTS
AND THE TELEPHONE CALLED IMMEDIATELY SO WELL THAT'S KINDA CUTE
NO BECAUSE I THIS IS THIS IS YEARS AGO IN THE UNITED STATES WHERE WE'RE DRIVING DOWN AND HE SAID CALL HOME
YEAH
WELL WHAT I CAN UH SUGGEST TO YOU CHRISTINE OKAY UH IF YOU NEED SOME UH THE TECHNICAL FEEDBACK
OR SOME TRAINING OKAY ABOUT UH THIS FACILITY ESPECIALLY FOR THE SPEECH RECOGNITION
I CAN RECOMMEND YOU SOME COMPANIES LIKE UH INTEL OR I. B. M. OKAY BECAUSE THEY'RE ALREADY IN THIS UH SPEECH RECOGNITION PART OKAY
AND UH YOU CAN MAYBE HAVE SOME UH TECHNICAL BACKUP FROM THEM SOME KIND OF A TECHNICAL TIE UP
OKAY SO WHAT KIND OF UH THE DETAILS YOU REQUIRE
OKAY AND UH IF YOU WANT I CAN COORDINATE OKAY TO GET SOME INFORMATION OKAY AND UH YOU CAN UH LET ME KNOW
OKAY TO ADD THIS FEATURE
IN THIS PROJECT
I DON'T THINK IT'S UH THE DIFFICULT
AND UH WE NEED TO KNOW HOW MUCH IS THE TIMEFRAME YOU NEED TO DEVELOP
APART FROM UH WHAT TODAY
OKAY WE'LL FIND THAT OUT
YEP
UH A RISK TAKE A RISK ON THE MARKET
WHAT DO THEY WANT
SOMETHING THAT'S GONNA COST MORE BUT COULD VERY EASILY S MAKE A BOOM IN THE MARKET
FROM FROM YOUR SIDE UH YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO BACK THE MANAGEMENT AND S BE MORE S PRECISE
YES
YES
YES
YEP
BECAUSE IT HAS TO BE SOMETHING TOTALLY DIFFERENT HAS TO BE TOTAL TOTALLY NEW
SOMETHING THAT NOBODY HAS RIGHT NOW
YEAH BUT BUT END OF THE DAY YOU'RE THE SALES GUY
SO I WILL COME BACK AND SIT ON YOUR HEAD BECAUSE UH YOU ARE GOING TO GIVE YOUR SALES PROJECTION OKAY
AND IT'S GONNA COST
IT'S UH OF COURSE IT'S UH GOOD TO UH TELL THE MANAGEMENT HOW MUCH IT'S COST US AND HOW MUCH YOU ARE GOING TO BENEFIT OKAY
MM-HMM
SURE
SURE
AND UH SO I DON'T MIND TO CONVINCE OKAY
THE MANAGEMENT TO SPEND SOME MORE MONEY ON THE PROJECT OKAY IF YOU CAN MAKE OUT OF
OBVIOUSLY
YES OKAY I DON'T MIND TO CONVINCE THE THE MANAGEMENT OKAY
THE MONEY FROM THIS PROJECT
IF THE BOTTOM LINE IS POSITIVE
MM
THE MANAGEMENT SAYS OKAY SO THEY THEY DON'T WANT CERTAIN FACILITIES WHICH IT'S ALREADY WORKED OKAY THEY WANT SOMETHING UH NEW OKAY
I THINK UH LIKE UH SPEECH RECOGNIT DEFINITELY THEY WILL AGREE I DON'T THINK THEY'LL SAY NO FOR THAT OKAY
AND UH I HOPE I CAN CONVINCE THE MANAGEMENT ON THAT OKAY
OKAY COORDINATION OKAY BETWEEN ANY UH TECHNICAL COMPANIES WHICH YOU CAN UH HIDE THEIR TECHNOLOGY BACKUP
SO IF YOU HAVE ANY UH NEW IDEAS OKAY
FOR UH YOUR YOU CAN ALWAYS COME UP AND UH YOU CAN TELL ME IF YOU NEED ANY UH S SPECIAL
OKAY FOR YOUR UH FUNCTIONAL DESIGN OR TECHNICAL DESIGN OKAY THEN I AM READY TO DO THAT
AND UH WHAT'S YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT UH
UM WELL I MEAN MAYBE IF I GO THROUGH MY PRESENTATION
YOU CAN SORT OF SEE WHAT THE USER PERSPECTIVE IS AND HOW IT TIES INTO THE OTHER TWO COMMENTS
MM
YEAH SO YOU ARE FINISH ED UH SO I CAN UH
YES
MM
OKAY I'LL UH HAND OVER TO AGNES
JUST GONNA CLOSE THIS
T
UH WHERE ARE YOU HERE
MM PARTICIPANT THREE
PARTICIPANT THREE
NOPE HERE
OKAY SO I'LL YEP
OKAY
GOOD
THANKS
YEAH AND THAT'S FINE
IS IT OKAY
ALRI
SO IN OUR CASE EXISTING REMOTE CONTROLS
OKAY
THE METHOD THAT WE USUALLY USE IN THE USER INTERFACE DESIGN IS THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT PEOPLE LIKE AND WHAT PEOPLE DON'T LIKE ABOUT EXISTING PRODUCTS
SO BASICALLY
AND THEN WHAT THE GOOD IDEAS ARE AND WHAT THE BAD IDEAS ARE AND WHY THEY'RE BAD AND GOOD WHICH ISN'T ALWAYS AS OBVIOUS
BUT WHEN YOU LOOK TECHNICALLY AT HOW IT WORKS SOMETIMES THAT'S NOT THE CASE
WE SEEM TO HAVE INTUITIONS ABOUT WHY THINGS ARE GOOD OR THINGS ARE BAD
THEN WE NEED TO DECIDE WHAT FUNCTIONALITIES WE REALLY WANT TO KEEP 'CAUSE THAT'LL FEED INTO BOTH ED'S WORK AND CHRISTINE'S WORK
UM AND THEN WHAT THE REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD LOOK LIKE OBVIOUSLY ONCE WE'VE GOT A GOOD IDEA OF WHAT THE FUNCTIONALITIES ARE
YOU NEED TO CHANGE CHANNELS BOTH BY DIRECTLY GOING TO A SPECIFIC CHANNEL OR BY CHANNEL SURFING
SO IN TERMS OF THE FUNCTIONALITIES THAT WE NEED YOU OBVIOUSLY NEED TO BE ABLE TO TURN THE T. V. ON AND OFF
YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO CONTROL THE VOLUME AND THEN CONTROL ANY MENUS ON THE T. V. TO REGULATE CONTRAST OR WHATEVER
SO THE PROBLEMS THAT PEOPLE HAVE EXPRESSED IS THAT THERE'S TOO MANY BUTTONS ON REMOTE CONTROLS IN GENERAL
THE BUTTONS IT'S NOT CLEAR WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO
UM OFTEN YOU NEED TO KNOW SPECIFIC BUTTON SEQUENCES TO GET CERTAIN FUNCTIONALITIES DONE
UM WHICH YOU DON'T NECESSARILY ALWAYS REMEMBER ESPECIALLY IF IT'S A FUNCTIONALITY THAT YOU DON'T USE VERY OFTEN
AND THAT THE BUTTONS ARE TOO SMALL
THE BUTTONS IN A LOT OF CASES ARE TINY
SO HERE WE'VE GOT TWO EXAMPLES WHERE HERE ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE YOU CAN SEE A REMOTE CONTROL THAT HAS LOTS AND LOTS OF BUTTONS
UM THEY'RE HARD TO SEE AND OKAY THEY'RE LABELLED BUT THE LABELS DON'T NECESSARILY TELL YOU TOO MUCH
AND IT SORT OF LOOKS SIMPLER AND JUST LESS IMPOSING WHEN YOU FIRST LOOK AT IT
SO I WOULD BE INCLINED TO GO SORT OF TOWARDS THIS IN TERMS OF DESIGN RATHER THAN THIS
WHEREAS ON THE OTHER SIDE YOU HAVE A MUCH SIMPLER REMOTE CONTROL THAT I THINK BASICALLY HAS THE MINIMUM FUNCTIONALITIES THAT ARE NEEDED
AND IF THERE'S SPECIFIC FUNCTIONALITIES THAT REQUIRE MORE BUTTONS THEN WE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT WITH EXISTING UM BUTTONS
SO LIKE THE ON BUTTON BEING REALLY OBVIOUS ONE THE CHANNEL CHANGING AND THE VOLUME AND TO KEEP THE DESIGN BASICALLY SLEEK AND SIMPLE
SO MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES ARE TO KEEP THE NUMBER OF BUTTONS TO A LIMIT OR TO A MINIMUM
SORRY MAKE FREQUENTLY USED BUTTONS BIGGER AND MORE STRATEGICALLY PLACED
CLICK MM
WHICH I THINK TIES INTO WHAT CHRISTINE AND ED HAVE BOTH SAID FAIRLY REASONABLY
UM SO THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT AN
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GUYS HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR
OH IT'S UM SEEMS VERY UNDERSTANDABLE
CLEARLY YOUR RESEARCH AND UH AND OURS UH HEADING IN THE SAME DIRECTION AND UM UH
YEP
THE ONLY THING THAT I SAW MISSING FROM UH YOUR YOUR RESEARCH THAT WE FOUND WAS THIS UH ABILITY TO FIND THE DOGGONE THING WHEN YOU NEED IT
YES THAT'S TRUE
YEAH
SO UH YOU KNOW BUT THAT'S OKAY
THAT'S WHY WE'RE ALL HERE AT THE TABLE SO THAT IF WE THINK OF IT AND OUR RESEARCH INDICATES CERTAIN THINGS AND UM W WE IT'S COMPLEMENTARY
YEAH
I ALSO THINK THAT UM UH TH F THE THE FEEL OF IT IS UH WHEN YOU HOLD IT
IS SOMETHING THAT UM UH WAS EXPRESSED MORE IN IN IN IN MY UH DESIGN
MM-HMM
YEAH
AND THAT'S LOGICAL AND NORMAL 'CAUSE THOSE ARE THE PARAMETERS THAT AN INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER'S MORE THINKING ABOUT TH TH THE LOOK AND THE FEEL AND UH YOU'RE
YEAH
ESPECIALLY TO USERS WHO ARE GONNA BE BUYING THE THING AND THEN USING IT ALMOST ON AN DAILY BASIS IN A LOT OF CASES I THINK
OH THAT'S DEFINITELY A VERY IMPORTANT FACTOR
YEP
FIRST
MM-HMM
OKAY SO I DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS
SOUNDS GOOD
MAYBE I CAN UH TRY TO HELP YOU TO GET SOME UH THE TECHNICAL UH THE COMPANIES TO HELP YOU FOR UH MAKE A DESIGN UH SLIM
OKAY AND TO ADD SOME FEATURES LIKE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE SPEECH RECOGNITION AND ALL
SO FOR ANYBODY NEED UH ANY HELP FOR TIME BEING ON THIS UH SUBJECTS OKAY SO PLEASE COME BACK TO ME AND UH CHRISTINE
OH
SHOULD WE MAYBE MAKE A DECISION ABOUT WHAT FEATURES WE ACTUALLY WANT TO INCLUDE 'CAUSE WE'VE THROWN A LOT OF FEATURES ONTO THE TABLE BUT
YEAH
DO WE ACTUALLY WANT TO INCORPORATE ALL OF THEM OR HAVE WE MISSED ANYTHING
HMM
DO YOU WANNA GO BACK AND LOOK AT THE CLOSING SLIDE MAYBE THAT WOULD PROVIDE SOME GUIDANCE
SURE
DOESN'T REALLY TELL US
SO NOT REALLY THIS ONE WE ARE TALK AB
INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS
WELL IT SAYS INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS IT SAYS USER INTERF SO I'M SUPPOSED TO DO THE COMPONENTS CONCEPT
YEP
SUPPOSED TO WORK ON THE USER INTERFACE CONCEPT AND YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO KEEP WATCHING THE TRENDS
MM-HMM
UM AND SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS WILL BE SENT BY OUR OUR COACH
I THINK WE SHOULD DO AS MANY FEATURES AS UH START WITH ALL OF THEM RIGHT NOW AND ELIMINATE THEM LATER IN THE PROCESS THAT'S MY SUGGESTION
I THOUGHT
OKAY THAT WILL BE GREAT
AND UH I'LL SEND YOU THE THE MINUTES OF MEET
YOU CAN OBJECT IF YOU WANT TO
NO I I'M JUST THINKING IN TERMS OF TIME LIKE IF
SHE'S OBJECTING
YES NOW I'M OBJECTING
I MEAN IT TAKES A LOT OF TIME AND EFFORT FOR EVERYONE TO CONSIDER DIFFERENT FEATURES UM
NO I MEAN I WAS JUST THINKING IS IT REALLY PRACTICAL TO START DESIGNING SOMETHING WITH FEATURES THAT WE'RE JUST GONNA END UP THROWING AWAY
YEAH
MAYBE IT'S BETTER TO SPEND IT ON THE F THINKING MORE ABOUT FEATURES THAT WE ACTUALLY DO WANT BUT
AND S IF WE SPEND THAT TIME AND EFFORT ON FEATURES THAT WE'RE NOT GONNA USE
OH TH WE S WE STILL HAVE
I THINK WE SHOULD TAKE THAT AS AN ACTION ITEM FOR AFTER THE MEETING 'CAUSE W OUR MEETING TIME HAS RUN OUT
SOMEBODY ELSE HAS GO TO USE THIS ROOM AND YOU KNOW WE CAN'T HANG OUT HERE AND TALK ABOUT THIS SO
I GUESS
YEAH
RIGHT
SURE
YEAH
SURE
YEAH
OKAY WHAT WE'LL DO IS NOW WE'LL TAKE FOR LUNCH BREAK OKAY THEN UH WE CAN DISCUSS FURTHERMORE
OKAY WITH OUR AREAS AND UH THEN WE WILL COME BACK AGAIN IN THE IN THE NEXT MEETING
SO THANKS FOR COMING AND UH I'LL SEND YOU MINUTES OF MEETING AND UH PLEASE PUT YOUR ALL INFORMATION IN THE SHARING FOLDER SO EVERYBODY CAN SHARE THE INFORMATION
OKAY
OKAY
SO LET'S GO FOR LUNCH THEN
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
AGREED
THANK YOU
UH WELCOME BACK AFTER LUNCH I HOPE UH YOU HAD A GOOD LUNCH
TOGETHER
FOR UH THIS MEETING THE MAIN AGENDA OKAY UH TO DISCUSS ABOUT THE
CONCEPTUAL DESIGN MEETING
OKAY AND THE AGENDA WILL BE
THE OPENING AND UH THAT'S UH THE PRODUCT MANAGER OR SECRETARY THAT'S ME AND UH THE PRESENTATIONS FROM THE CHRISTINE AND UH
AGNES AND FROM MISTER ED
AND FINALLY IN THIS MEETING WE HAVE TO DECIDE
AND WE ARE TO TAKE A DECISION ON THE REMOTE CONTROL
CONCEPT AND UH THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN
SO WE HAVE FORTY MINUTES I THINK IT'S UH
LITTLE BIT UH LOW BUT I I HOPE WE CAN FINISH IT UP SO I'LL HANDLE TO THE
THE FUNCTIONAL TEAM TO THE CHRISTINE OKAY TO DISCUSS ABOUT UH THE COMPONENTS CONCEPT
I'M NUMBER TWO
OKAY
SO UH IF YOU COULD OPEN THE POWERPOINT PRESENTATION
YOU'RE NUMBER TWO
'KAY
COMPONENTS DESIGN THERE WE GO
YEAH
SO UH CAN WE PUT IT IN SLIDE SHOW MODE
THE NEXT ONE
RIGHT HERE IS THAT LITTLE THAT ONE YES PLEASE
I'LL TAKE THE MOUSE
THANK YOU
SO UH
YOU HAVE TO HAVE MICROPHONE WELL NO YOU DON'T ACTUALLY I HAVEN'T HAVE TO HAVE MICROPHONE IN THE DEVICE
UM SO THE OTHER W THING THAT WE SO
WE WERE LOOKING HE SPECIFICALLY AT THE COMPONENTS UH THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS UH THE CASE THE POWER SUPPLY UH THE MEANS OF COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE TELEVISION SET
WHAT HASN'T AND THEN WE ALSO UM WE WANTED TO EVALUATE SOME NEW MATERIALS AND WE CONTACTED MANUFACTURING FOR THEIR INPUT BECAUSE
SO IT COULD BE IN THE TELEVISION SET COULD BE IN THE DEVICE BUT SOMEWHERE YOU HAVE TO PUT THE MICROPHONE
BUT UM MAYBE YOU DO HAVE IT A A WAY IT HAS TO IT HAS TO HEAR THE SPEAKER AND UM
SO UH THIS IS THE APPROACH THAT WE TOOK DURING OUR UM OUR RESEARCH
IN INSTANCE WE HAD TALKED ABOUT USING SOME SORT OF SPEECH RECOGNITION
OUR METHOD FOR GOING ABOUT THIS IS WE'VE LOOKED AT UH THE HISTO HI HISTORICAL RECORD WHAT'S WORKED
COURSE WE M MIGHT COME UP AND CHOOSE THE MATERIAL THAT THEN MANUFACTURING DIDN'T HAVE THE TECHNOLOGIES OR CAPABILITIES TO OFFER US
UM AND A W A WAY OF MAKING BEEPS OR SOUNDS SO YOU CAN FIND IT WHEN IT'S GETS LOST
MM-HMM
SO UM FOR THE CASE UM WE TOLD WE WERE MAKING A SPECIFICA SPECIFIC ASSUMPTION THAT IT WOULD BE CURVED IN DESIGN
BUT UM THAT UH DOESN'T SEEM TO B BE ONE OF THE CHOIC NON OPTION WE CAN UH WE CAN REALLY SERIOUSLY EXPLORE
SO THEN WE WERE THINKING ABOUT UM RUBBER
BUT UM UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S BEEN ELIMINATED BECAUSE OF THE HEAT UH FACTOR AND TH UM THERE MIGHT BE SOME PROBLEMS WITH THE M UH HOW IT'S
COURSE YOU KNOW I WANTED IT TO BE EXPANDABLE AND SHRINKABLE
UH GOES WITH THE BOARD
SO UM WE STILL HAD TITANIUM AND AND WOOD AVAILABLE BUT UM UNFORTUNATELY UH UH TITANIUM'S ALSO BEEN ELIMINATED UH
ALTHOUGH HOW APPLE DID IT WITH TH POWERBOOK I'M NOT SU QUITE SURE BUT UH NEVERTHELESS UM THEY'VE ELIMINATED ALL OF OUR OPTIONS EXCEPT WOOD
UH AND UH THEN TH PLASTIC ALSO HAS THIS PROBLEM OF MELTING AND IT'S BRITTLE IT GETS BRITTLE AFTER A WHILE
THE M PEOPLE IN MANUFACTURING SAID THAT YOU COULDN'T MAKE D CURVED CASES OUT OF TITANIUM
AT LEAST IT'S ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY
BUT UH THESE SIMPLE CHIPS BUT THAT'S ONLY WORKS FOR THE BU YOU DON'T GET VERY MUCH UM INTELLIGENCE WITH THIS SIMPLE ONE
AND UM THEN THERE WAS THE REGULAR WHICH I REGRET THAT I'VE FORGOTTEN EXACTLY WHY I'M ELIMINATING THAT ONE
AND A AS SHE SAID IT'S AN ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY UH MATERIAL
SO THEN THERE'S THIS OTHER MATTER OF THE CHIPS AND UM WELL WE COULD USE A SIMPLE DESIGN ON THE BOARD
AND UH WE LIKED TH WE WE FOUND THAT IT IT INCLUDES THIS INFRARED SENDER
SO WE'RE WE'RE CURRENTLY UH PROPOSING UH WE'LL GET TO ALL MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES IN JUST A SECOND
SO THIS IS OUR FINDING
WHICH W 'MEMBER THE BEAM WAS THAT WAS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF FINDING THE RIGHT CHIP
UH THE OTHER OPTION WAS THIS ADVANCED CHIP ON PRINT
SO THIS IS THE FINDINGS OF OUR RESEARCH AND MY RECOMMENDATIONS UM FOR THE NEW REMOTE CONTROL W UM WOULD BE TO HAVE UM HAVE IT BE MADE OUT OF WOOD
DO YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEMS WITH THAT
AND UH MANUFACTURING HAS TOLD US THAT THEY'VE UM UH RECENTLY DEVELOPED A UH A SENSOR AND A SPEAKER THAT WOULD UH BE INTEGRATED INTO THIS ADVANCED CHIP ON PRINT
I THINK THAT PEOPLE WILL MIGHT REALLY WANT TO DESIGN THEIR OWN CASES YOU SEE
AND THEN THEY COULD SUBMIT THEIR ORDERS KINDA LIKE YOU SUBMIT A CUSTOM CAR ORDER YOU KNOW
WELL YOU GUYS COME FROM TROPICAL COUNTRIES SO YOU CAN KINDA THINK OF SOME TREES AND SOME NICE WOODS
SO UH WE WE UH NOW JUMPING RIGHT TO OUR PERSONAL PREFERENCES UM I I'D REALLY THINK WE SHOULD
YOU KNOW USE SOME OF UH SOME REALLY EXOTIC WOODS LIKE UM YOU KNOW UH
AND YOU CAN CHOOSE THE COLOUR AND THE SIZE OF THE WHEELS AND THE COLOURS OF THE LEATHER AND THINGS LIKE THAT
THEY COULD DO SORT OF A THIS UM THREE DIMENSIONAL DESIGN ON THE INTERNET
AND THEN I UH THINK WE SHOULD GO WITH THE SOLAR CELLS AS WELL AS THE UM MICROPHONE AND SPEAKER ON THE ADVANCED CHIP
CAN YOU GO BACK UH ONE SLIDE
LET'S GO BACK UP HERE
I'M NOT SURE HOW DO I OH I KNOW LET'S SEE
THANK YOU
YEAH
WHAT'S THE MEANING OF THAT
YES UH QUESTION UH WHAT'S MEAN EXACTLY ADVANCED CHIP ON PRINT
I THINK IT'S UM UM A MULTIPLE UH CHIP DESIGN UM AND IT'S UH MAYBE PRINTED ON TO THE CIRCUIT BOARD
MM-HMM
UH I COULD FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THAT UH BEFORE THE NEXT FI NEXT MEETING
YEAH IS IT MEANS IT'S ON THE YEAH IS IT ON A MICRO PROC MICRO PROCESSOR BASED OR UH
I DON'T KNOW BUT I'LL FIND OUT MORE AT OUR NEXT MEETING
OKAY THA THAT WOULD BE GREAT SO IF YOU FIND OUT FROM THE TECHNOLOGY BACKGROUND OKAY SO THAT WOULD BE GOOD
SOUNDS GOOD
WHY WAS THE PLASTIC ELIMINATED AS A POSSIBLE MATERIAL
BECAUSE UM IT GETS BRITTLE
CRACKS
MM-HMM
UM
WE WANT WE EXPECT THESE UM UH THESE REMOTE CONTROLS TO BE AROUND FOR SEVERAL HUNDRED YEARS
GOOD EX GOOD EXPRESSION
SO
WHIC
WELL AFTER US
WOW GOOD EXPRESSION
WHICH
I DON'T KNOW SPEAK FOR YOURSELF I'M PLANNING TO BE AROUND FOR A WHILE
ALTHOUGH I THINK
I THINK WITH WOOD THOUGH YOU'D RUN INTO THE SAME TYPES OF PROBLEMS WOULDN'T YOU I MEAN IT CHIPS
IT IF YOU DROP IT UH IT'S I'M NOT SU
SO SO YOU'RE NOT CONVINCED ABOUT THE THE WOOD YES
I'M READY TO SELL IT
ACTUALLY I'M READY TO SELL IT
YOU'RE WHAT
I THINK IF YOU RE IF YOU USE REALLY GOOD QUALITY WOOD THEN IT MIGHT WORK BUT YOU CAN'T JUST USE
YOU THINK
AND YOU COULD YOU COULD SELL OILS WITH IT TO TAKE CARE OF IT
EXTREMELY HARD WOOD BUT THERE ARE SOME VERY PRETTY WOODS OUT THERE
NO Y NO NO NO THE O THE ONLY W THE ONLY WOOD YOU CAN USE ARE THE ONES THAT ARE HARD
YEAH EXACTLY YEAH
WELL I'M GLAD YOU
THAT'S ACTUALLY VERY INNOVATIVE IDEA
SORR HAVING A HARD TIME KEEPING WI CONTROL OVER MY FACE
OKAY GOOD
WELL IT'S ACTUALLY A VERY INNOVATIVE N DIFFERENT IDEA THAT UH YOU KNOW YOU CAN CHOOSE YOUR COLOUR OF WOOD YOUR TYPE OF WOOD
MM-HMM
THE STAIN
I MEAN IT'S EACH PERSON IS GONNA HAVE THEIR OWN PERSONALISED INDIVIDUALISED SPEECH RECOGNITION REMOTE CONTROL IN WOOD THAT'S NOT ON THE MARKET
MM
YEAH SO IT IT'S LOOKS GOOD THE THE DESIGN THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN UH WHAT ABOUT YO YOU
UM IN TERMS OF COMMENTS ON THIS OR IN TERMS OF MY OWN
YES IN T YES IN TERM IN TERMS OF COMMENTS FIRST
IN TURNS OF WOW
SHE WORKS IN THE CUBICLE NEXT TO ME SO SHE'S UH SHE WAS ALREADY A LITTLE BIT PREPARED FOR THIS
LUCKILY ED WAS NOT
Y YEAH
WOOD
I THINK WE CAN GET THE QUALITY MATERIALS THEN IT SHOULDN'T INFLUENCE THE DESIGN PRINCIPLES TOO MUCH WHICH YOU'LL SEE WITH MY PRESENTATION
ONE THING WE'D HAVE TO CHECK THOUGH IS WHAT THE USERS WHETHER HOW QUICKLY THE NOVELTY WEARS OFF OF HAVING UH YEAH FOR EXAMPLE
SO HAVE TO SEE HOW KID FRIENDLY IT IS AND AND ALL THAT BUT
YEAH YOU WOULDN'T WANNA HAVE TO HAVE SPLINTERS IN YOUR HAND WHILE YOU'RE USING YOUR
MM-HMM
IT'S REALLY GOOD IF YOUR DOG GETS AHOLD OF IT THEY CAN USE IT FOR TEETHING
THEY DO THAT ANYWAY WITH THE RUBBER AND PLASTIC SO AND CHEW 'EM UP
YEAH THEY DO IT WITH OTHER MATERIALS AS WELL YEAH
AND CHEW 'EM UP
OKAY THEN UH LET'S MOVE TO AGNES
SURE
OH I'M SORRY
S YOU'RE
YOU ARE IN PARTICIPANT THREE
ONE POINT THREE YEAH
UH YEAH
THIS ONE
I THINK SO YEAH
AND ACTUALLY THE OTHER THING WITH THE WOOD IF WE TAKE YOUR CUSTOMISING IDEA IS THAT PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY DO SORT OF QUASI MEASUREMENTS ON THEIR HAND SIZE
'CAUSE I'M ACTUALLY GONNA DRAW YOU THE LAYOUT ON THE BOARD SO IF YOU WANT TO JUST GO STRAIGHT TO THE SECOND SLIDE
UM WHICH BASICALLY SHOWS
VOLUME AND CHANNEL CONTROL THE MENU ACCESS BUTTON ERGONOMIC SHAPE WHICH I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH CHRISTINE'S IDEA TO HAVE IT SORT OF MOLDED
SO IT'S SLIGHTLY MORE ERGONOMIC AND COMFORTABLE TO HOLD THAN THE R STANDARD VERY STRAIGHT REMOTE CONTROLS
SO IF SOMEONE HAS LARGER HANDS YOU HAVE A WIDER REMOTE CONTROL
SORT OF I TOOK THE IDEAS THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT LAST TIME UM AND TRIED TO PUT THAT INTO THE REMOTE CONTROL SO THE THINGS THAT Y YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE ON IT ARE THE ON OFF SWITCH
SO IT'S A VERY SHORT PRESENTATION
YEAH THAT'S THE ONE
RIGHT MY HAND IS UH DIFFERENT SIZE THAN YOURS FOR EXAMPLE
SO IN TERMS OF WHAT THIS THING WOULD ACTUALLY LOOK LIKE
UM ONE THING I THOUGHT MIGHT BE KIND OF INTERESTING IS TO PUT A FLIP SCREEN ON IT JUST LIKE YOU HAVE ON FLIP PHONES
ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE LITTLE KIDS AROUND THEY'RE NOT PRESSING THE BUTTONS WHILE YOU'RE TRYING TO WATCH A T. V. SHOW AND ACCIDENTALLY CHANGE THE CHANNEL OR TURN IT OFF
SO THAT YOU DON'T HAVE THIS CASE WHERE SOMEONE SITS ON THE REMOTE CONTROL OR ACCIDENTALLY PUTS THEIR HAND ON IT
SO I THOUGHT MAYBE WE COULD PUT A LITTLE BATTERY LIFE LIGHT ON IT THAT KIND OF GOES DIMMER AND DIMMER AND DIMMER AS YOUR BATTERY IS STARTS TO DIE
AND ALSO UM YOU HAD ISSUES WITH THE BATTERIES RUNNING OUT
AND IN TERMS OF INVISIBLE FEATURES AUDIO AND UM TACTILE FEEDBACK ON BUTTON PRESSES AND LIKE YOU SAID SPEECH RECOGNITION
SO THAT'S ACTUALLY A REALLY GOOD IDEA FOR CUSTOMI CUSTOMISABILITY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
DESPITE WORKING IN INTERFACE DESIGN I'M NOT THE GREATEST ARTIST IN THE WORLD SO YOU'LL HAVE TO FORGIVE ME
AND THEN YOU HAVE SORT OF ONE OF THOSE TOGGLE DISPLAYS FOR OOPS
SO YOU DON'T ACCIDENTALLY TURN YOUR T. V. OFF WHILE YOU'RE TRYING TO MANOEUVRE OTHER BUTTONS
YOU'D HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THIS WITH AN ON OFF SWITCH FAIRLY BIG SORT OF IN THE CORNER AND BY ITSELF
CHANNELS AND VOLUME SORT OF FOR SURFING CHANNELS AND THEN VOLUME
SO THE VOLUME WOULD BE THE UP AND DOWN 'CAUSE VOLUME GOES UP AND DOWN AND THEN CHANNELS LEFT TO RIGHT
AND THEN HERE YOU'D HAVE YOUR SORT OF STANDARD TELEPHONISH
NUMBER PAD
SO THAT IF THE USER DOESN'T WANT TO USE THEIR VOICE THEY CAN JUST TURN IT OFF AND YOU DON'T HAVE THE REMOTE CONTROL ACCIDENTALLY CHANGING THINGS ON YOU
AND THEN ON ONE SIDE YOU WOULD HAVE AN ACCESS TO THE MENU ON YOUR T. V. AND ON THE OTHER SIDE A WAY TO TURN OFF THE VOICE CONTROL
MM
MM-HMM
UM SO AGAIN YOU CAN HAVE A LITTLE L. C. D. LIGHT SOMEWHERE THE FLIP
THING AND HAVE I FORGOTTEN ANYTHING
I DON'T THINK SO
SO AS YOU CAN SEE IT'S A VERY VERY SIMPLE DESIGN WHICH IS ONE OF THE THINGS I REALLY WANTED TO KEEP
THINK THE DESIGN CAN PRETTY MUCH CARRY OVER TO EVERYTHING ALTHOUGH WITH THE WOOD THE FLIP SCREEN MIGHT HAVE TO DO SOMETHING SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT
IS KEEP IT SIMPLE NOT HAVE TOO MANY BUTTONS NOT HAVE TOO MANY FUNCTIONALITIES THROWN INTO IT
NO
A HINGE
BE LIKE A COPPER HINGE OR YOU KNOW
BUT THAT'S THE GENERAL LAYOUT WITH THE GENERAL FUNCTIONALITIES IF WE COME UP WITH SOMETHING ELSE
YEAH
YOU DON'T WANT IT TO START GETTING TOO HEAVY
BUT YOU ALSO HAVE TO D START WATCHING OUT FOR THE WEIGHT
AS YOU CAN SEE THERE'S STILL LOTS OF SPACE ON THE ACTUAL REMOTE CONTROL AND IF YOU DO IT CUSTOMISABLY
YOU CAN MAKE THIS THING FAIRLY SMALL OR FAIRLY O LARGE DEPENDING ON PERSONAL PREFERENCES
'CAUSE DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH THE THE FLIP SCREEN WILL ADD TO THE WEIGHT OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
MM-HMM
MM
MM-HMM MM-HMM
HMM
UM THE CENTERING OF THE KEY PAD AND
SO THAT'S PRETTY MUCH ALL I HAD TO SAY I MEAN EVERYTHING ELSE IN TERMS OF DESIGN ISSUES
SO THAT WOULD BE SORT OF IN DIRECT LINE OF WHERE YOUR THUMB GOES WHEN YOU ARE HOLDING THE REMOTE CONTROL
THE CHANNEL IS JUST DEPENDING ON WHERE YOUR THUMB IS AND YOU TEND TO USE THE THE VOLUME CONTROL AND UH THE BROWSING MORE THAN THE ACTUAL NUMBER PAD
THE NUMBER PAD A LITTLE BIT LOWER 'CAUSE IT'S USED LESS FREQUENTLY
MM-HMM
MM
MM-HMM
SO ONCE WE DECIDE EXACTLY WHAT WE WANT THEN WE CAN FIGURE OUT THE EXACT POSITIONING BUT MORE OR LESS I THINK IT SHOULD GO ALONG THOSE LINES
SO WHAT'S YOUR UH THE COMMENTS OR UH
S
SIMPLE DESIGN
IT'S WHAT CONSUMERS WANT
OKAY
IT'S ALMOST LIKE HOUSTON WE HAVE A PRODUCT HERE
PROBLEM IS OBVIOUSLY GONNA BE COST
MM-HMM
OKAY I ALSO HAVE A F VERY SIMPLE PRESENTATION BECAUSE FOR THE MARKETING POINT YOU HAVE TO SEE WHAT THE CONSUMERS WANT
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
I ALSO HAVE UH COPIED A
DIFFERENT TYPE OF REMOTE
IF YOU CAN FIND ME WHERE I'M AT
THERE SHOULD ONLY BE ONE IN HERE
TREND WATCH
SURE
IT'S BEING MODIFIED
THEY'RE STEALING OUR PRODUCT
UH THEY ALREADY ERASED THE REST OF MINE HUH
IN SIX MONTHS MAYBE THIS IDEA IS ALREADY GONE OUT THE WINDOW SO IT'S GONNA BE A QUESTION HOW FAST WE CAN ACT
WE'VE BEEN GIVING SIMPLE QUESTIONNAIRES IN DIFFERENT AREAS BECAUSE TH OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE TO SEE WHAT THE COM CONSUMERS ARE LOOKING FOR TODAY
'CAUSE UH TRENDS CHANGE VERY VERY QUICKLY
NO F GO TO FINDINGS
NO NO
NO NO NO NO
THIS IS WHAT WE KNOW FROM THE LAST UH FROM THE QUESTIONNAIRES FROM THE THE ALL THE P SURVEYS WE'VE DONE
EASY TO USE HAS ALWAYS HAS BECOME HAS BECOME ANOTHER MAJOR INTEREST THAT UH WITH THE WHITEBOARD WE CAN SEE THAT IT'S A REMOTE THAT'S EASY TO USE
UH THE MARKET TREND
THEY ALL DO THE SAME THING WE HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
FANCY AND FEEL GOOD THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR SOMETHING THAT FEELS GOOD IN THE HAND THAT'S EASY TO USE
OKAY
'CAUSE I HAD ANOTHER COMMENT THERE
LOOKING FOR NEXT GENERATION OF INNOVATION BECAUSE ALL THE REMOTES OUT THERE NOW THEY'RE ALL VERY SIMILAR
THE FIRST ONE I SEE THAT THEY PUT IN A DISPLAY
SO EVEN IF WE HAVE A PRODUCT THAT MAY BE MORE EXPENSIVE IF IT COMES OUT RIGHT IF THEY LOOK IT LOOKS AND FEELS GOOD AND HAS TECHNOLOGY
AND I THINK THIS IS ANOTHER THING THAT'S INTERESTING IS THE CONSUMERS ACTUALLY WILLING TO PAY THE PRICE FOR EXCITING TEL TECHNOLOGY
THE SECOND TWO YOU CAN SEE THE LAST ONE IS A VERY EASY SIMPLE DESIGN
THE SECOND ONE THERE IS ABOUT UH FORTY FIVE THOUSAND DIFFERENT BUTTONS ON IT WHICH MAKES IT FAIRLY HARD TO READ UH VERY HARD TO USE
NOW THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE UH WITH THE LITTLE FLIP UP NOW WE'RE ADDING ALL KINDS OF THINGS IN BUT WITH THE LITTLE FLIP UP
MAYBE THE DISPLAY ALSO MAKES IT EASIER TO USE BECAUSE SOMETIMES WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING FOR BUTTONS MAYBE IF YOU SEE A DISPLAY
IF YOU HAVE A LITTLE DISPLAY ON THE FLIP UP THAT WHEN YOU CLOSE IT EVERYTHING IS LOCKED
MM-HMM
YEAH
CONTEXT SENSITIVE INSTRUCTIONS DEPENDING ON WHAT THE TEL WHAT MODE THE T. V. OR THE D. V. D. OR SOMETHING ELSE IS IN
RIGHT
OKAY
SO MAYBE IF WE CAN INCORPORATE THE EASINESS OF USE
NOW YOU HAVE IT NOW YOU HAVE ONE WITH THE VERY SIMPLE ALSO
THE IDEA IS SIMPLE BUT WITH A DISPLAY SO YOU CAN SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING
BECAUSE I'VE SEEN MOSTLY THE STANDARD ONES YEAH
ESPECIALLY YOU MIGHT NEED SOMETHING LIKE THAT FOR TRAINING THE SPEECH RECOGNITION AND YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
TRENDY FANCY FEELS GOOD
UH WITH A DISPLAY
WOOD DESIGNER WOOD DESIGNER COLOURS WE MIGHT'VE
AND THEN THEY WOULD SQUEEZE IT AND IT WOULD TAKE THE SHAPE OF THEIR HAND
MAYBE WHAT YOU COULD DO IS WHEN SOMEBODY ORDERS THE DEVICE ID YOU COULD SEND THEM LIKE UM A UH UH B SOME SORT OF A FOAM RUBBER UM BALL
YOU KNOW
OH YEAH
YEAH SO IT'S REALLY MOLDED TO TO YOUR SPECIFIC
TO T AN AND THEN YOU WOULD KNOW LIKE UM WHAT THE GEOMETRY OF THEIR HANDS WOULD BE AND UH
MM-HMM
HOW HARD THEY SQUEEZE
RESISTANCE RESISTANCE RIGHT
YES YOU'D KNOW WHAT KIND OF WOOD TO GET
BUT TH FOR THAT YOU'D ALSO HAVE TO DO SORT OF AN AVERAGE ACROSS FAMILIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT IF UNLESS EVERYONE HAS THEIR OWN PERSONAL REMOTE
THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT YOU WOULDN'T WANNA GO TOO FAR DOWN THAT
OH THAT THAT ACTUALLY WOULD UH INCREASE THE UM THE REVENUES WE COULD EXPECT YEAH
THE SALES YEAH
THE
YEAH
I HOPE SO
NO BUT INCORPORATING THE THREE UH OBVIOUSLY IT'D BE SOMETHING TOTALLY NEW ON THE MARKET TOTALLY DIFFERENT AND FROM
YEAH
WELL ALREADY THE CUSTOMISABILITY IS A REALLY GOOD SORT OF NEW GIMMICK
RIGHT YOU TAKE IT APART AND PUT ON ANOTHER FACE TAKE IT OFF AND PUT ON ANOTHER FACE AND THEN THEY SOLD MILLIONS MILLIONS
ALTHOUGH WHAT IT WAS IT UH IT WAS UH NOKIA THAT CAME OUT WITH THIS CHANGEABLE COLOURS
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
RIGHT MM
AND THAT TOOK OFF YEAH YEAH
SO
SO SAY WITH THE F WITH THE FINDINGS WITH THE RESEARCH EASY TO USE SOMETHING TOTALLY NEW
WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING TOTALLY NEW THAT IS NOT ON THE MARKET
MM-HMM
WE MIGHT WANNA UM LEARN ABOUT UM LABOUR LAWS
WE'D ALSO HAVE TO WOR UM CONSIDER THAT UH WHO WE WERE GONNA GET TO MAKE THESE CUSTOM CASES IN TERMS OF MANUFACTURING PROCESSES
YOU KNOW IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AND STUFF WHER SO WE CAN DO IT CHEAP BUT YOU DON'T WANNA EXPLOIT UH LABOUR IN UM THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES
SO ACTUALLY YOU COULD TURN IT Y TURN AROUND AND SAY THAT YOU'RE UH PAR THE REASON THE COST IS HIGH FOR THE DEVICE IS BECAUSE UM YOU'RE PAYING A A WORKING WAGE TO THE PERSON WHO MADE THE DEVICE
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH BUT WE CAN GET A PRODUCTION IN UH COUNTRIES LIKE UH INDIA YES YES
COUNTRIES LIKE INDIA OR CHINA OR MALAYSIA SO YOU CAN GO A BETTER FEATURES AND BETTER PRICE AND YOU CAN SELL MORE
COST OF LIVING IS LOW
SO
GOOD WELL TH THAT'D BE SOMETHING THAT MANUFACTURING WOULD HAVE TO UM EXPLORE MORE AND TO WHERE MM-HMM
YEAH YEAH SO
MM YEAH
YES
WHERE W WHERE IT WOULD BE MANUFACTURED IS IS
SO
ANOTHER STEP
WE'RE HERE TO DESIGN
YEAH SO
YEAH
SO WE DON'T NEED TO HAVE OUR OWN UH FABRIC FACTORY OR SOMETHING SO WE CAN HAVE A TIE UP WITH WHO THE DO THE FABRIC OKAY
FOR THE DIFFERENT UH ELECTRONICS ITEMS THEN WE CAN HAVE A BUSINESS TIE UP AND TO GET TO CUT THE COST OKAY TO SELL MORE
YES UH BUT UH THAT THAT WE CAN THAT WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE PRODUCTION LATER OKAY DEPENDS ON THE THE QUANTITY OKAY
COME UP WITH A NICE PRODUCT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OKAY IF IS ACCEPTABLE FOR BOTH OF YOU WHAT UH ED WAS TALKING
SO BUT UH LE LET'S DECIDE FIRST ABOUT THE COMPONENTS CONCEPT AND UH INTERFACE CONCEPT
AND YOUR DESIGN WHETHER YOU WANT WITH THE DISPLAY OR WITHOUT DISPLAY OR JUST A SIMPLE SO
MM-HMM
I THINK IT DEPENDS I MEAN I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA
BUT WE NEED TO REALLY THINK ABOUT HOW USEFUL IT'S GONNA BE BECAUSE THEORETICALLY WITH THE T. V. YOU ALREADY HAVE A BIG DISPLAY RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU
YEAH
HMM
SO IF WE'RE TRYING TO KEEP COSTS DOWN THEN MAYBE SACRIFICING THE DISPLAY
HMM
I MEAN IT DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH PUTTING A DISPLAY COSTS AND WHAT IT WOULD BE USED FOR VERY SPECIFICALLY WHAT IT WOULD BE USED FOR
'CAUSE IF IT'S ONLY USED FOR ONE LITTLE THING THEN PUTTING IN A BIG DISPLAY CASE OR A BIG DISPLAY THAT'S
IS A WAY TO GO
HMM
MM-HMM
PROBABLY EXPENSIVE JUST TO DO THE TRAINING ON THE CHIP FOR THE SPEECH RECOGNITION OR WHATEVER MAY NOT BE THE MOST COST EFFICIENT WAY TO GO BUT
THAT'S JUST SORT OF SPECULATION I MEAN
DO YOU HE LIKED THE DISPLAY IN ONE OF THE CONCEPTS THAT YOU SHOWED UM
DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH IT COSTS UM TO TO ADD A LITTLE DISPLAY LIKE THIS UH
WHAT DO YOU THINK ED
NO NO P SPEC IT'S 'CAUSE WE HAVE TO FIND OUT COST ON IT
NO
DO YOU WANNA TAKE AN ACTION ITEM TO GO FIND OUT
OKAY
SORRY ABOUT THAT
ONCE WE GET A PRICE ON IT THEN WE CAN MARKET IT
I'M HERE FOR THE PUSHING IT AFTER IT'S MADE
I WILL MARKET IT
UM NO THAT'S NO PROBLEM
YES
SO THE THE ADVANCED CHIP ON PRINT IS WHAT UM WHAT WE'VE
WE'VE DECI WE'VE DETERMINED AND THE UH ENGINEERING INDUSTRIAL DESIGN IS THE RECOMMENDATION
AND UM I THINK WE'VE KINDA COME TO SOME AGREEMENT REGARDING UM THIS CONCEPT OF A WOODEN CASE
MM-HMM
A CUSTOMISABLE AND
NICE BEAUTIFUL MAHOGANY RED WOODEN CASE
WHAT ABOUT THE BUTTONS WOULD
WOULD THE BUTTONS BE WOOD TOO OR
UH I DON'T THINK SO NO I THINK THEY COULD BE RUBBER LIKE THEY ARE NOW SO YOU HAVE THAT TACTILE EXPERIENCE OF
I DON'T THINK SO
YES
YES
DON'T LOOKS NICE UH
IN CASE WE GO FOR THE DISPLAY
YEAH SO UH WHAT WE'LL DO IS UH
WE WILL STICK WITH THE THE SIMPLE DESIGN FOR TIME BEING UNTIL UH TH ED FIND OUTS ABOUT THE HOW MUCH IT'S COST TO THE EXTRA
OKAY
OKAY
SO MAYBE WHAT YOU CAN DO IS UH BOTH OF YOU YOU CAN COME UP WITH THE THE PROTOTYPE OKAY THE MODEL
MM-HMM
OKAY
SURE
SO UM ARE WE DONE WITH THIS MEETING
YEAH I HOPE IF IS IT OKAY IF UH THEY WILL COME UP WITH THE PROTOTYPE DESIGN OKAY
OKAY
THEN THEY CAN SHOW YOU HOW IT LOOKS LIKE AND THEN WE CAN UH SUBMIT TO THE I WILL SUBMIT TO THE MANAGEMENT
THEN MEANTIME YOU CAN COME UP WITH THE PRICE HOW MUCH IT'S COST AS EXTRA FOR UH THE DISPLAY
AN AND THE MARKETING STRATEGY THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT OKAY
AND A MARKETING STRATEGY
FIRED
AND MARKETING STRATEGY THANK YOU
YES
HOW MUCH YOU CAN
HOW MU HOW MUCH HOW MUCH YOU CAN SELL EXTRA
OF COURSE YOU'LL MAKE MONEY TOO SO IT
IT'S NOT ONLY PAY OUT YOU MAKE MONEY TOO YOUR COMMISSION
OKAY SO ANY QUESTIONS
NO
SO BY NEXT MEETING SO PLEASE COME UP WITH THE THE PROTOTYPE OKAY THEN UH THEN WE CAN PROCEED FROM THERE
OKAY
MM-HMM
SO THANKS FOR ALL YOUR UH EFFORTS AND COMING FOR THE MEETING AGAIN AND SEE YOU SOON THEN
OKAY
THANK YOU
IT'S OKAY
OKAY
I'M SORRY TO BE LATE
WELCOME BACK
WELCOME BACK EVERYBODY
YEAH
THANKS
SO THIS MEETING AGENDA WILL BE THE DETAILED DESIGN MEETING
AND UH
OPENING AND UH P. M. S OF THE MEET MINUTES UH PROTOTYPE PRESENTATION FROM UH CHRISTINE AND UH AGNES
AGNES YES
YES AND UH EVALUATION CRITERIA
SO WE HAVE FORTY MINUTES TO DISCUSS AND UH FINALISE AND CLOSE THE PRODUCT AND PROJECT AND TO MOVE FURTHER OKAY SO
THE FINANCE IT'S UH FROM MY SIDE FROM THE MANAGEMENT AND UH PRODUCTION EVALUATION
THEN UH CLOSING
OKAY LET'S TALK ABOUT UH MAYBE FIRST UH FOR THE PROTOTYPE
MM OKAY
SO I HANDLE TO
I'VE DONE A PRESENTATION BUT IT PRETTY MUCH COVERS WORK THAT WE'VE BOTH DONE SO IF I'M MISSING ANYTHING CHRISTINE CAN JUST CORRECT ME
SO SHALL I GO TO SORRY
UH THANK YOU SO YOU DID A POWERPOINT PRESENTATION GOOD FOR YOU
YEP
S
OKAY LET'S GO TO A. M. I.
IT'S NOT THE BIGGEST POWERPOINT PRESENTATION IN THE WORLD BUT
SO IN TWO OR THREE OR
THREE
UM
NO IT'S THINK IT'S THE LAST ONE
PROBABLY
TECHNICAL PA I WOULD THINK
NO THEN THIS IS THE LA YEAH THAT ONE FINAL DESIGN
IT IS NAMED APPROPRIATELY YOU JUST COULDN'T SEE THE NAME
UM OKAY CAN I HAVE THE MOUSE
HA
YEAH
YES
THANKS
ALRIGHT SO
FROM WHEN WE WERE DISCUSSING SPECIFYING THE CASE IN THE LAST MEETING WE DECIDED THAT WE WANTED AN ERGONOMIC SHAPE
THE MATERIAL THAT WE CHOSE WAS WOOD AND UH THE COLOUR WOULD BE CUSTOMISABLE 'CAUSE YOU CAN STAIN THE WOOD WHATEVER COLOUR
UM SO IN TERMS OF FUNCTION YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO TURN THE T. V. ON AND OFF
AND WE'VE INCORPORATED THE L. C. D. SCREEN ON THE FLIP PANEL AS PART OF THE DESIGN
IF WE FIGURE OUT IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE WELL THEN YOU JUST TAKE IT OFF
UM SO
VOLUME AND CHANNEL CONTROL MENU CONTROL VOICE RECOGNITION CONTROL
TO UNVEIL OUR LOVELY PRODUCT
THIS IS OUR REMOTE CONTROL WITH THE FLIP PANEL AS YOU CAN SEE
UM THIS IS ACTUALLY HARD TO DO
SO IF YOU LIFT UP THE PANEL YOU CAN SEE THE LOVELY YELLOW L. C. D. DISPLAY
THE YELLOW BUTTON YOU HAVE IS THE ON OFF BUTTON SO IT'S REALLY BIG HARD TO MISS
SO UP VOLUME UP DOWN VOLUME DOWN
YOU HAVE THE THE RED UM TRIANGLES ARE THE TOGGLES FOR CHANGING THE VOLUME
THE GREEN ARE THE CHANNEL CHANGING
S AND IT'S ONE OF THOSE VERY LIGHT VERY TOUCHABLE DISPLAYS
AND ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE YOU HAVE THE THE THE ABILITY TO TURN OFF THE VOICE RECOGNITION
SO THIS IS PRETTY MUCH WHAT WE HAD ON THE WHITE BOARD THE LAST TIME
AND THEN YOU HAVE THE NUMERIC PAD IN THE DARK BLUE AT THE BOTTOM AND ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE YOU HAVE THE ACCESS TO THE MENU ON THE T. V.
MM-HMM
SO
UM AND UH I COULD
ADDITIONAL FEATURE ON THE BACK IS THAT YOU CAN HAVE YOUR OWN CUSTOMISED BACKING AND I SUPPOSE YOU COULD DO THE SAME THING ON THE FLIP CASE ON THE FRONT
OH YES
SO THAT YOU CAN REALLY MAKE THIS A HIGHLY HIGHLY CUSTOMISABLE REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH THE D
THAT DEPENDS ON THE UH S DESIGN OF THE CIRCUIT BOARD INSIDE AND UH WHAT ROOM IS LEFT UM
WE HAVEN'T UM UH SPECIFIED WHERE THE SPEAKER OR THE MICROPHONE WILL BE PLACED
YEAH
I THINK THE MICROPHONE IS ON ON THE TOP UH ON THE MIDDLE THE UNDER THE FLIP
YES OKAY
UH-HUH
SO THAT WILL BE THE SAFE SO P ANY THE CHIP IT'S NOT ON THE CHIP BECAUSE YOU NEED TO HAVE MICROPHONE TO
NO I MEAN IT DEPENDS ON THE DESIGN OF THE CIRCUIT BOARD
YES
BUT IT SHOULDN'T BE UNDER THE FLIP EITHER BECAUSE YOU CAN HAVE THE REMOTE CONTROL CLOSED BUT YOU STILL MIGHT WANT TO ACTIVATE IT BY VOICE
UH IT'S IT'S
'CAUSE MOST OF THE TIME YOU SPEAK THEN IT WILL BE RECOGNISED
OKAY SO THEN YOU CAN SPEAK THEN YOU CAN CLOSE IT
YEAH BUT UH UH MY OPINION I THINK IT'S BETTER UNDER THE FLIP BECAUSE WHENEVER YOU WANT TO UH THE TALK
BUT IF YOU PUT IT ON THE ON THE FLIP OKAY THEN UH TECHNICAL I DON'T THINK IT'S UH FEASIBLE
I MEAN THE WHOLE POINT OF THE VOICE IS THAT IF THE REMOTE CONTROL IS SITTING THERE AND I'M TOO LAZY TO REACH OVER AND PICK IT UP
WHY USE THE VOICE WHY NOT JUST USE YOUR HAND
BUT IF YOU'VE ALREADY GOT THE REMOTE CONTROL IN YOUR HAND YOU NEED TO OPEN THE FLIP TO USE THE VOICE
I CAN JUST USE MY VOICE
MAYBE I'VE GOT MY HAND IN THE POPCORN BOWL AND I'M HOLDING MY CUP OF COCA COLA IN THE OTHER HAND
YEAH
AND YOU DON'T WANNA LET GO OF EITHER ONE
YEAH
LOUDER
I DON'T WANNA SAY
I MEAN IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE ON THE FLIP IT CAN BE ON THE SIDE SOMEWHERE
CAN ALSO BE ON THE SIDE
SO THAT'S GOOD IDEA
YEAH THE SIDES MAYBE IS GOOD
YEAH
MM-HMM
SO I MEAN I CAN PASS THIS AROUND IF ANYONE WANTS TO
YES
SO IT'S MAYBE GOOD IDEA
YEAH Y BETTER YOU PASS IT AROUND WITH A NAPKIN
BECAUSE Y YOU CAN EASILY PUT A MICROPHONE ON THE SIDE THAT WOULD HAVE NO PROBLEM WOULD HAVEN'T BEEN NOT BE DAMAGED OR ANYTHING
AND IT'D BE ACCESSIBLE ALL THE TIME TO VOICE
NO
YEAH
YES
YEAH
YEAH EXACTLY
YEAH
SO IT'S MAYBE GOOD IDEA
S S
IT'S UM
COMPLIMENTS TO THE ARTIST
IT'S UM
YOU NEED TO WORK ON THE WEIGHT A LITTLE BIT
AND MAYBE THE SHAPE OF THE BUTTONS THE LITTLE EGG SHAPES AREN'T THE MOST ECONOMICAL BUT
YES
UH
S
OKAY
I'M FINE I'M SATISFI I'M SATISFIED
WE'RE GLAD YOU'RE SATISFIED
OF COURSE IT'S IT'S IT'S LOOKS MORE HEO HEAVY BUT I THINK WHEN IT'S COMPLETELY MAYBE IT'S A LESS WEIGHT
WE COULD HAVE POSSIBLY MADE IT A LOT THINNER AS WELL
I MEAN THIS IS PLASTICENE
YEAH
THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH YOU CAN DO
YES
BUT
AND PART OF THE THING IS M A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY THAT THEY DON'T LIKE SOMETHING THAT'S TOO LIGHT
SO I MEAN MAYBE THIS IS EXCESSIVELY HEAVY BUT I THINK IT NEEDS TO HAVE SOME WEIGHT IT NEEDS TO FEEL LIKE YOU'RE STILL HOLDING SOMETHING
BECAUSE THEY DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE ENOUGH CONTROL OVER IT
MM-HMM
YEP
SO THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT FOR OUR PRESENTATION ACTUALLY
THAT'S YOUR UH PROTOTYPE MODEL
OKAY THAT'S GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH
SO ANY COMMENTS OR UH
YEAH
WELL THE PROTOTYPE IS IS VERY WELL WITHIN THE DESIGN AND IDEAS THAT WE'VE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT ON THE PREVIOUS MEETINGS
NOW IT GOES INTO THIS NEXT PHASE AS THE FINANCIAL UH MARKETING UH
OKAY
YES THAT UH
SO I'LL COME BACK TO THE
I HAVE SOME UH CALCULATIONS WHICH I MADE UH AS FOR UH THE BUDGET
SO EVALUATION CRITERIA I THINK UH THAT WILL BE GOOD SO THEN LET'S COME TO THE FINANCE UH
SO HERE YOU CAN UH LOOK LIKE UH THE ENERGY AND UH DYNAMO AND UH KINETIC AND SOLAR CELLS
UH IT'S OPTIONAL SOMEWHAT OPTIONAL AND ED WANTS THE CHIP ON PRINT THAT'S WHAT UH WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THAT
SO THEN WE HAVE SAMPLE SENSOR AND SAMPLE SPEAKER THEN UH WE HAVE THE WOOD MATERIAL THEN SPECIAL COLOUR AND PUSH BUTTON
SO IT'S UH ACTUALLY OUR BUDGET WAS UH TWELVE POINT FIVE EURO BUT UH IT'S COMING TO NINE POINT NINE FIVE EURO
SO WE ARE UNDER UH BELOW THE BUDGET OKAY SO STILL WE ARE SAVING SOME MONEY
I THINK IT'S A GOOD FIGURE
CONGRATULATIONS
YES GREAT I I'M SURPRISED
THAN THANK YOU
WELL WE HAVEN'T COME TO MINE YET SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE A BIT OF DIFFERENCE OF OPINION YES
IT'S GONNA COST A LONG WAY TO C YOU KNOW COST A LOT OF MONEY TO MARKET IT IS IT
OH OKAY
SO MAYBE IT'S FOR SOME MONEY WE CAN UTILISE FOR OUR UH MARKETING FOR THE SALES OKAY AND UH
WELL IT JUST DEPENDS ON IF WE'RE GONNA ADD A O ON THIS PR
PROVISIONARY COST ANALYSIS WE DO NOT HAVE A L. C. DISPLAY
L. C. DISPLAY IS GONNA BE VERY EXPENSIVE IT'S GONNA BE
NO WE DO BUT IT'S NOT FILLED IN
OH YEAH YEAH YOU'RE RIGHT SORRY YES
IT'S NUMBER THIRTY
WE DON'T HAVE THE PRICE UP THERE OKAY SO IF WE ADD APPROXIMATELY TWO TO THREE EURO PER
IT'S NOT IT DOESN'T SAY
YEAH
YEAH
IT'S NOT
THIRTY
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
UM
REMOTE NOW WE'RE UP AROUND ABOUT TWELVE TWELVE AND A HALF AS TO WHAT UH THE COMPANY HAD INITIALLY UH REQUESTED
SO THAT MEANS WE CAN PUT THE UH
BUT AS FAR AS PRODUCTION UM I'M PUTTING UP A QUESTION BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PROFIT ALSO AND IN MINE YOU'LL SEE UH
DISPLAY IN
THE L. C. D. IN YEAH
WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE MARKET ETCETERA ETCETERA BECAUSE THAT HAS TO BE TAKEN IN INTO CONSIDERATION
THE PROBLEM WITH UH OUR SURVEY THE P THE POSSIBILITY THAT HOW MANY UNITS CAN BE SOLD
UH THIS IS JUST PRODUCTION COST IT IS NOT UH ADVERTISING COST IT'S NOT TRANSPORTATION COST UH
YES SO STILL UH WE HAVE TWELVE POINT FIVE EURO
AND THAT WILL INFLATE QUITE A BIT THE COST OF THE UH THE COST OF THE UNIT FOR THE COMPANY
SO TO COME UP WITH WHAT THE COMPANY WANTS IS A FIFTY MILLION POUND PROFIT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO A LONG WAYS
YES
YEAH BUT
YES
YEP
UM HMM
YES
THIS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ONE UNIT OKAY SO WHEN IT GO INTO THE QUANTITY OKAY AND THE COST WILL COME DOWN
YES
ALTHOUGH CUSTOMISATION BECAUSE THIS IS BEING DONE YOU KNOW THE ON ON ORDER BASIS
WOULD BE IN PRODUCING QUANTITY BUT THE COST OF THE CASE WOULD UH BE FIXED AT THE
IT MIGHT BE UH THE THE QUANTITY WON'T M WON'T UH THE CIRCUIT BOARD WILL B YOU'RE RIGHT
SLIGHTLY
YEAH
IT'S GONNA BE VERY HARD TO REDUCE
YES
THAT'S REALLY THAT'S THE COST OF THE MATERIAL AND LAB WOW THAT'S REALLY OUTSTANDING
UH YOU GOT SOME PRETTY CHEAP LABOUR THAT CAN DO THIS CASE FOR ONE EURO
THAT'S NOT BAD
YEP
YEAH
BUT ANYHOW STILL WE ARE UNDER CONTROL OKAY SO WHAT UH I WILL DO IS I WILL TRY TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE VENDORS
I WILL SPEAK TO THE MANAGEMENT AND HOW TO GET UH YOU KNOW SOME MORE UH COST DOWN
WHATEVER OKAY SO THAT UH I WILL LOOK AFTER
OKAY TO GET UH THE PRODUCTION COST LESS OKAY
SO THEN WE CAN SAVE SOME MONEY OKAY TO PUT INTO TH OUR MARKETING OR UH YOU KNOW THE PROMOTIONS
IF WE CAN GO TO TO MY DISPLAY
AND WE'LL COME BACK TO YOURS JUST TO GIVE EVERYBODY AN IDEA OF THE MARKET
YES
SO NOW I'M GONNA SCARE EVERYBODY OUT OF THIS PROJECT
YEP
IF I'M STILL HERE
YOU'RE IN FOUR
THE FOUR GIVES ME IT'S GOTTA BE UH TRENDWATCH
TRENDWATCH
IS THIS THE SAME ONE YOU DID BEFORE
NO
OKAY
YOU HAVE TO GO BACK AND FIND ANOTHER ONE
IT SHOULDN'T BE IF IT'S NOT IT'S NOT THE RIGHT ONE
NO NO WE G NO THAT'S THE SAME ONE
THAT'S NO I THINK IT'S THE SAME ONE
WHATEVER NAME IT POPPED UP UNDER
UH FUNCTIONAL TRY FUNCTIONAL IT MIGHT NOT BE IT EITHER BUT WE'LL SEE
FUNCTIONAL
IT LOOKS LIKE IT THERE'S
ALTHOUGH SINCE UH WE NEED TO HAVE SOME TYPE OF IDEA ON A MARKET UH WE HAD INDEPENDENT STUDY THAT SAYS IT THIS THIS MARKET HAS AN AVAILABILITY TO ABSORB EIGHT MI EIGHT MILLION UNITS PER YEAR
YEP THAT'S IT
OUR INTERNAL COMPANY EVALUATION PUTS IT BETWEEN EIGHT TO NINE MILLION WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY THE SAME AS THE INDEPENDENT STUDY
OKAY
SO WE'LL GO SCREEN BY SCREEN
S YEAH
OKAY
YEP
SO IF WE CONTINUE WE'LL LOOK AT THE FINDINGS
NEXT SCREEN
WHICH IS ACTUALLY A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT
WHICH MEANS THAT UH IF WE HAVE A TARGET OF TWO MILLION WOULD THE COMPANY HAS TO TAKE TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE MARKET IN THE FIRST YEAR
MM-HMM
YEAH NO KIDDING
NO KIDDING YEAH
MAYB MAYBE THEY ALREADY EXPECTED SOMETHING
TRANSPORT FOR THE MATERIAL TO THE STORES OR WHATEVER HOW HOWEVER WE'RE GONNA BREAK THIS DOWN BETWEEN OUR OUR RETAILERS
SO IF WE PUT AN INFLATED PRICE OF FIFTY EURO AT A PRODUCTION COST THAT CANNOT EXCEED TWENTY FIVE EURO
OKAY WE'RE ALREADY IN THAT THAT PRICE OKAY WITH TRANSPORT
PROMOTION LABOUR BECAUSE WE HAV GI INCLUDED THE PROMOTION IN THE COST
YES
UM HMM
OKAY
TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE MARKET TO GET TO TWO MILLION UNITS
AT TWO MILLION UNITS WE HAVE TO HAVE A PROFIT OF TWENTY FIVE EURO PER UNIT TO GET TO THE FIFTY MILLION UNIT EU EURO PROFIT
MM-HMM
YEP
NOW THE COMPANY MUST EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY OF BEING ABLE TO TAKE ENOUGH OF THE MARKET TO JUSTIFY IN PRODUCTION
THE FAN UH THE FANCY STYLISHNESS OF THE OF THE UNIT THE EASE OF USE SPEECH RECOGNITION COST WE'VE GONE THROUGH THESE
SO OBVIOUSLY WE W W I JUST DID A RUN DOWN THE EVALUATION OF THE FORM
OR WE PROJECT THIS OVER TWO YEARS BUT BEING THAT THE MARKET CHANGES VERY VERY QUICKLY
CAN THE COMPANY SELL TWO MILLION UNITS
CAN IT SELL IT FOR FIFTY EUROS
SO NOW WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH A DECISION
MAYBE THERE'S NO MORE INTEREST IN BUYING THIS THING IN EIGHTEEN MONTHS FROM NOW
YES
YEP
OF COURSE
MM
YEP
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE THE TRANSPORT TO THE UH POINT OF SALE
THE POINT OF SALE IS ONLINE
THAT WAY YOU HAVE NO STORAGE YOU HAVE NO UM YOU DO HAVE TRANSPORTATION STILL HAVE THE LABOUR COST
UH UH UM I WOULD UH LIKE TO EXPLORE THE POSSIBILITY OF USING UM ALTERNATIVE UM DELIVERY AND SALES CHANNEL WHICH WOULD BE UM TO USE THE INTERNET FOR PROMOTION AND ORDERING AND THEN TO DROP SHIP THE P PRODUCT TO THE CUSTOMER'S RESIDENCE
COULD COULD I GO TO FINDINGS
YEP
I WAS THINKING THE SAME THING YEAH
YES
DIRECTLY
UM HMM
YES
YEAH
TO THE AGENTS
YEAH
YOU CAN DO A SHIPPING CENTRE SOMEWHERE OR STRATEGICALLY PLACE SHIPPING CENTRES TO MINIMISE DISTANCE COSTS
RIGHT LIKE AMAZON
OR EBAY YEAH
IN FACT WE SHOULD SELL THROUGH AMAZON DON'T YOU THINK
YES
OR EBAY OR
YES
YEAH
GOING WITH UM
THERE'S AN IDEA
YEAH THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
TO IMPRO MORE PROFIT AND UH
S UPSCALE TECHNOLOGY
WELL
YEAH YES
AH WE WE'RE DO YOU KNOW SELLING A UNIQUE PRODUCT UH
WHEREAS IF YOU'RE IN A STORE YOU CAN'T UNLESS YOU'RE A HIGHLY IMAGINATIVE PERSON
YOU MAY NOT REALLY KNOW WHAT IT IS YOU WANT
SEE MAYBE WHAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE DONE WHAT THE RANGE OF POSSIBILITY AS
WHEREAS ON THE WEB IF YOU HAVE A BUNCH OF PICTURES IT CAN SORT OF TRIGGER IDEAS AND
THAT ACTUALLY MAKES MORE SENSE IF WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT SO HIGHLY CUSTOMISABLE 'CAUSE ON THE WEB PEOPLE CAN LOOK AT THE DIFFERENT OPTIONS THEY HAVE
MM
THERE ARE SEVERAL COMPANIES THAT HAVE GONE THAT WAY
MM
MM-HMM
AND YOU CAN EVEN HAVE AN A MOVIE THAT YOU CAN ROTATE THE OBJECT AND LOOK AT THE DI THE ONLY THING THAT YOU'RE MISSING REALLY IS THE WEIGHT
YEAH
THE WEIGHT AND FEEL
WEIGHT THE FEEL OF THE PRODUCT BUT
MM
YEAH
IT'S NOT QUITE LIKE TRYING ON A SHOE BUT
WE'RE GETTING USED TO THAT
PEOPLE ARE GETTING USED TO BUYING THINGS ONLINE THAT THEY CAN'T TOUCH BEFORE BUYING
YEAH
YEAH
THERE ARE SEVERAL THAT HAVE GONE THROUGH WITH THE WATCHES TOO
YOU CAN CUSTOMISE A WATCH YOU CAN SEE HOW IT IS AT THE F AT THE END OF THE PRODUCTION YOU CAN CHANGE IT UH
MM-HMM
UH-HUH
THERE'S A LOT OF ONLINE THAT'S THAT IS DOING THIS NOW
YES
WHICH COULD YOU KNOW FEASIBILI FEASIBILITY UH LOWER THE PRICE OF THE UNIT
MAYBE THERE'S A POSSIBILITY OF SELLING MORE THAN TWO MILLION UNITS IN ONE YEAR
AND WHEN YOU'RE ROTATING YOU'LL LOOK BEHIND AND LOOK THIS WAY UH IT'S POSSIBLE TO DO WITH THIS
YEAH
MM-HMM
WE CAN
GREAT
THEN UH YOU CAN EVALUATE THE PRODUCT SO HOW IT LOOKS LIKE TECHNICALLY AND UH HOW IT LOOK LIKE UH THE REAL
I DON'T THINK THAT'S UH NOT POSSIBLE IT'S UH OKAY THEN L UH LET'S WAIT FOR THE PRODUCTION OKAY
WHAT TURNAROUND TIME DO WE HAVE
T
'CAUSE I MEAN PRODUCTION EVALUATION CAN BE VERY VERY QUICK OR VERY VERY LONG
OH BUT
IT WILL UH COME BACK IN TWO WEEKS OKAY IT WILL BE READY IN TWO WEEKS
YES IT'S IT'S VERY QUICK OF COURSE
FOR EVALUATION OKAY
WORKS FOR ME
PROTOTYPES YOU MEAN
IN UM
YES THE PROTOTYPE UH PROTOTYPE PRODUCT EVALUATION
WE PROBABLY SHOULD DO SOME MARKET TESTS UH ONCE WE HAVE THE PROTOTYPES AND DO SOME ORDERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND TEST MARKET IT
YES
WELL OBVIOUSLY
YES
YES
YEAH
MM THAT'D HAVE TO BE THROWN OUT ON THE MARKET FOR PEOPLE TO GET AN IDEA TO SEE GET GET THEIR
YEAH
SO YOU CAN TAKE A MINIMUM TWO WEEKS TO A MAXIMUM FOUR WEEKS
MM-HMM
THINK MINIMUM TWO WEEKS IF WE'RE GONNA DEVELOP PROTOTYPES AND THEN TRY TO TAKE THEM TO DIFFERENT PLACES AND SEE HOW PEOPLE USE IT'S NOT A TRIVIAL TASK
YEAH
YEAH BECAUSE WE WE ARE NOT GOING TO DO IT IN UH OUR FACTORY OKAY SO WE CAN GIVE IT A PRODUCT EVALUA YES YES
WE DEFINITELY SHOULDN'T DO IT IN OUR FACTORY
NO NO
SO WE'LL DO IT IN THE OTHER PLACE AND I DON'T THINK IT'S TAKE MORE THAN FOUR WEEKS TIME
OR UH
OKAY SO THEN THE REAL PRODUCTION WE WILL START ONCE WE PRODUCT EVALUATION OKAY
THEN UH IT'S APPROVE FROM UH THE TECHNICAL TEAM AND UH YOUR TEAM OKAY UH FROM THE MANAGEMENT THEN WE CAN LAUNCH IN THE MARKET
HM
ANY OUTSTANDING
S ANY ANY OTHER UH QUESTIONS OR UH COMMENTS TO BE DISCUSS
NO I'M GO AHEAD
WHAT AB
I THINK WE PRETTY MUCH COVERED EVERYTHING
OKAY SO THEN UH
DID YOU HAVE SOMETHING
WELL I WAS JUST WONDERING ABOUT IF WE'RE GONNA DO A PRODUCT EVALUATION THEN WHAT ABOUT TIME FOR REDESIGN IF THE USERS COME BACK AND TELL US NO THIS IS BAD
THIS IS BAD WE WANT THIS DONE DIFFERENTLY
SO NO MORE CHANGES WILL BE MADE OKAY IN THIS THE BASIC DESIGN
LET'S PROCEED WITH THIS MODEL OKAY FOR THE FOR THE MARKETING DIRECTION OKAY
OKAY UH LET'S TAKE LIKE THIS
SO WE WILL INTRODUCE M THIS MODEL AND UH LET'S INTRODUCE IN THE MARKET AND LET'S TAKE THE FEEDBACK FROM THE CUSTOMERS THEN WE CAN UH GO FOR THE
OKAY
SECOND GENERATION
SECOND GENERATION
EVERY EVERY CUSTOM
OKAY
THERE'S NO END THERE'S NOT LIMIT
THE PROBLEM IS THERE MIGHT NOT BE A SECOND GENERATION IF THE FIRST GENERATION FLOPS FOR SOME SILLY REASON THAT WE HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF
WELL THEN IT MAY NOT BE
OKAY
WELL EVERY CUSTOMER OKAY THEY HAVE THEIR OWN IDEAS THEY HAVE THEIR OWN TEST OKAY SO THERE'S NO END THERE'S NO LIMIT
LIKE PEOPLE DON'T LIKE WOOD
BUT THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RELEASING A PRODUCT THAT HAS BEEN MINIMALLY TESTED AND FINE TUNED TO SUIT A GENERAL RANGE OF REQUIREMENTS VERSUS RELEASING A PRODUCT THAT WE THINK WILL WORK BUT WE DON'T REALLY HAVE ANYTHING TO BACK IT UP
NO
VERY SPECIFIC
YEAH SO THAT'S THE REASON YOU ARE HERE FOR UH THE DESIGN OKAY I HOPE YOU MADE A GOOD DESIGN
I MEAN THE WHOLE POINT OF USER EVALUATION IS TO SEE WHAT REAL PEOPLE NEED
WE HAVE OUR OWN MOTIVATIONS IN MIND WE HAVE OUR OWN IDEAS IN MIND BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THAT'S WHAT'S GONNA SELL
YES BUT I'M NOT EVERYBODY
LIKE UH YOU CAN EAT UH YOU CAN ALL EAT MORE CHI I CAN EAT MORE CHILLI OKAY
SO I IT'S A DEPENDS ON THE INDIVIDUAL TASTE YOU KNOW SO WE HAVE WE HAVE TO BALANCE SOMEWHERE
YEAH BUT UH SEE WE OUGHT TO TAKE A FEW CONSIDERATIONS OKAY ONE IS THE PRICE CONSIDERATION ONE IS FUTURE CONSIDERATION OKAY
I'M JUST TRYING TO POINT OUT THAT I THINK THAT YOUR EVALUATION AND REDESIGN TURNAROUND TIME IS TOO SHORT WELL YOU HAVE NO REDESIGN NOT YOU PERSONALLY
BUT IN THE PROJECT WE HAVE NO REDESIGN TIME AND
YEAH OF COURSE
YES
OUR PROJECT DOESN'T UM
YEAH
ED D DO YOU KNOW WHAT SEASON OF THE YEAR OR TIME OF THE YEAR IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FOR T. V. REMOTE CONTROL SALES
HMM
WOULD IT BE THE CHRISTMAS SEASON BY ANY CHANCE
SPORTS SEASON
THE SPORTS TIME
WORLD SOCCER
WORLD CUP SOCCER THEY NEED THOSE THINGS THAT THEY HAVE THEIR HANDS G OCCUPIED AND THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO TALK TO THE CON REMOTE CONTROL
RIGHT BEFORE THE EUR THE WORLD CUP
WHICH SPORT SEASON
FOOTBALL
SO SO
YEAH
FOOTBALL
MAYBE WHAT
SO I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS PERHAPS TO SYNCHRONISE THE FINAL THE THE LAUNCH OF A USER TESTED DEVICE WITH SOME SPECIAL EVENT
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHEN THE WORLD CUP IS BUT I'M SURE THERE'S GONNA BE ONE
AND AND THEN UM SO THAT GIVES US A LITTLE MORE TIME PERHAPS THEN WE ANTICIPATED
YES
YES
YEAH THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
OR ANY MAJOR SPORTS
I THINK THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE TOO AGGRESSIVE UM BUT SO
PROBABLY NOT THE UM THE FOOTBALL GAMES COMING UP THE END OF JANUARY
OR ANOTHER M MAJOR SPORTS EVENT
I'M JUST IG UH POINTING OUT A UH A STRATEGY TO UH DO SOME ADDITIONAL USER TESTING PRI AND THEN TO LAUNCH UM AT A A MAJOR SPORTS EVENT OR UH PERHAPS TO UH ALSO
YES
YEAH
RESEARCH
MM-HMM
YEP
THAT'S ACTUALLY GOOD PLACE TO ADVERTISE IT TOO
AND TO WORK WITH MOTION PICTURES
MAYBE SOME MANAGEMENT HAS GOT UH RELATIONSHIPS THERE WE CAN LEVERAGE
SO WE COULD MAYBE WORK OUT A CAMPAIGN WITH UH WITH SONY PICTURES FOR EXAMPLE
THERE MIGHT BE SOME MOTION PICTURES THAT ARE COMING OUT UM THAT ARE COMING OUT ON D. V. D. THAT UH THEY NEED TO HAVE A M SPECIAL REMOTE CONTROL TO WORK WITH IT
YEAH
YES
MM-HMM
YES THE THAT OF COURSE UH I WILL CONVINCE THE MANAGEMENT TO DO THAT OKAY
THAT'S GREAT
WHEN IN FACT IT GETS RE RELEASED A FEW YEARS DOWN THE LINE WITH PROPER TESTING AND IT TAKES OFF LIKE CRAZY
IT'S JUST SOMETHING TO TO KEEP IN MIND 'CAUSE IT'S REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT
A LOT OF PRODUCTS HAVE GONE OUT THERE WITHOUT BEING PROPERLY USER TESTED AND COMPLETELY FLOPPED
SURE SURE YES
YOU'RE RIGHT TIMING IS VERY IMPORTANT BUT I THINK WE'VE GOT A GOOD PRODUCT
AND UH PEOPLE THE MARKET HADN'T REALLY GOTTEN ON TO THE CONCEPT THAT YOU COULD USE SOMETHING AND THEN THROW IT AWAY
'CAUSE IT WASN'T UH BUT THEN WHEN THEY RE LAUNCHED THEM THIRTY YEARS LATER THEY WERE VIRTUALLY THE SAME DESIGN BUT PEOPLE HAD GOTTEN THE THROW AWAY YOU KNOW
DISPOSABLE DIAPERS IS AN EXAMPLE OF THAT IN FACT
PAPER CUPS AND NAPKI Y ALL KINDS OF THINGS THAT THEY HADN'T UM SO
YES IT IS ONE OF THE FIRST CONSUMER PRODUCTS THAT WAS LAUNCHED ABOUT THIRTY YEARS THAT WAS A DISPOSABLE CONSUMER PRODUCT
THAT I DIDN'T KNOW
REALLY
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
I THINK HE CAN PROMOTE THE THE BRAND VALUE AND THE PRODUCT VALUE
YES
THAT'S THE REASON ED IS HERE
THAT'S RIGHT
IT'S GONNA BE VERY IMPORTANT TO THE COMPANY
WE ARE BEHIND THE SCENE AND HE IS THE FRONT SCREEN SO
YEP
YEAH I'M THE ONE WHO TAKES THE HEAT
IF IT'S A FLOP IT'S THE MARKETER
HE'S ON THE BIG SCREEN
EXACTLY
GOOD LUCK ED
YOU LOOK VERY RELAXED CONSIDERING H YOU KNOW THE UH THE WEIGHT ON YOUR SHOULDERS YEAH
YES
STRESS
YES
OKAY FOR UH BUT OUR TIME BEING
SO THANKS FOR ALL YOUR EFFORTS AND GREAT WORK AND UH GREAT DESIGN AND UH LET'S LEAVE IT TO THE ED FOR LATER FOR ONCE PRODUCTION IS
OKAY SO THEN UH LET'S COME TO THE CLOSING AND UH ARE THE COSTS WITHIN THE BUDGET AND UH IS THE PRODUCT EVALUATED
OKAY SO THAT WILL UH COME SOON

BRILLIANT
OKAY PERFECT
NICE EH
YEP
NOW WE JUST HAVE TO SAVE EVERYTHING SO
YEAH THANK YOU
OH THIS IS DEFINITELY THE BEST ONE
UH
OKAY SO
UH WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT WE HAVE TO SELL THIS UH REMOTE CONTROL FOR ABOUT TWENTY FIVE EUROS
EXCUSE ME
AND UH WE HAVE TO MAKE A PROFIT OF FIFTY MILLION EUROS SO WE HAVE TO UH USE A BIG MARKET IN EUROPE
OKAY THAT'S
PIECE OF CAKE
THE PRODUCTION COST ARE ABOUT HALF THE PRICE OF SELLING PRICE SORRY
UH EASY
SO CAN SOMEONE MAKE A
A CALCULATION ABOUT HOW MANY WE HAVE TO SELL OF THESE TO MAKE FIFTY MILLION I DUNNO
UH SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE A LITTLE DISCUSSION ABOUT UM WHAT EXPERIENCE ARE WITH A REMOTE CONTROL THE AND EVERYTHING
SO JUST HAVE A LOOK HOW IT WE THINK ABOUT REMOTE CONTROLS
YEAH MY FIRST QUESTION WAS DOES IT HAVE TO BE A A UNIVERSAL REMOTE CONTROL
OH YEAH THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION
BECAUSE WE SELL IT UH UH UH LONELY FROM THE T AND NOT WITH THE TELEVISION WE SELL IT UH APART
I THINK IT'S I'M NOT I'M NOT SURE IT'S NOT MM I THINK
SO I
YEAH IT PROBABLY WOULD BE UNIVERSAL
OR MORE DEVICES
UNIVERSAL
AND ONLY TELEVISION
BECAUSE
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN BUY A A A UNIVERSAL UH REMOTE CONTROL FOR TWENTY FIVE EUROS SO NOT SURE BUT
HMM MAYBE I DON'T KNOW
YEAH I KNOW UH YOU CAN BUY A RE A UNIVERSAL UH CONTROL FOR UH ONLY TWENTY UH EUROS
OKAY SO WE WE JUST SAY WE JUST SAY THAT'S UNIVERSAL REMOTE CONTROL
OKAY PERFECT
YEAH I THINK
AH OKAY
AND UH ALSO FOR THE V. C. R. AND UH D. V. D. PLAYER AND OKAY
YEAH EVERYTHING JUST SO A LOT OF BUTTONS ON THE REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH PROBABLY
NOT JUST A T. V.
NO JUST EVERYTHING
OKAY
IT'S NOT NOTHING VERY SPECIAL BUT UM YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
SO YEAH WHAT WHAT WHAT'S A REMOTE CONTROL IT'S JUST A BLACK THING WITH SOME BUTTONS ON IT
OKAY
WELL WE CAN TRY TO MAKE IT SPECIAL
SO DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS HOW IT HAS TO LOOK FOR FOR USABILITY OR USER
WELL
UM IF WE UH CONTROL THE V. C. R. AND THE D. V. D. PLAYER PLAYER WITH IT
WELL I TH I THOUGHT ABOUT UM MAKING IT THE SAME UH STYLE AS THE TELEVISION
WE DON'T HAVE UH THE SAME TELEVISION UH ALL THE TIME SO UH THAT'S NO MATTER
UH IT HAS TO BE CLEAR BECAUSE UH KIDS AND UH ELDERLY ARE GONNA USE IT SO UH IT'S NOT ONLY FOR THE UH TECHNICAL PERSONS
UM
I THINK IT MUST BE A VERY GOOD CONTROL SO YOU CAN UH UH UH ACT UH USE IT FROM UH EVERYWHERE IN YOUR ROOM
THE THE INFRARED UH THING MUST BE FROM VERY GOOD QUALITY
HMM YEAH
SHOULD BE A GOOD POINT
THAT'S RIGHT
NOTHING
YEAH
OKAY
AND HOW BIG SHOULD IT BE
N
I DUNNO UM
YEAH
NO
IT SHOULDN'T BE TOO BIG BUT I DON'T THINK WE CAN MAKE IT TOO SMALL 'CAUSE IT HAS TO HAVE A LOT OF FUNCTIONS SO
YEAH
WE CAN'T MAKE IT SMALLER THAN THE THINGS WE SEE NOW I THINK
JUST BIG ENOUGH FOR THE BUTTONS WE HAVE THAT'S THAT'S IT
YEAH
OR WE HAVE TO MAKE SOMETHING UH
MAYBE THEN YOU CAN MAKE IT S SMALLER AND UNIQUER
LIKE UH MOBILE PHONES THAT YOU CAN UH FOLD IT OPEM
YEAH
YEAH
YES
MAYBE MORE TRENDY
BUT YOU YOU YOU YOU THINK ABOUT UH UH ONE YOU CAN FOLD OPEN
OKAY YEAH THAT'S COOL
MAYBE FOR THE D. V. D. PLA PLAYER OR SOMETHING IF YOU JUST OKAY
FOLD OPEN WHERE YOU CAN SEE UH MORE OPTIONS
I THINK
AH THAT'S THAT'S
YEAH N
YEAH SOMETHING UH ON TOP JUST DREN GENERAL THINGS LIKE VOLUME AND T. V. CHANNELS AND INSIDE THINGS YOU DON'T USE THAT OFTEN
AH RIGHT RIGHT
YEAH OR YOU C
YEAH
OH THAT'S GOOD YEAH
O OR YOU COULD TH THINK OF AN UH UH A SMALL TOUCH SCREEN ON THE REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH B I WANTED
YEAH
THERE ARE BUTTONS ON IT
WHY SHOULD YOU USE A TOUCHSCREEN ON A REMOTE CONTROL
UH MAYBE BE UH IT'S IT'S
NO YOU CAN MAKE AN UH MANUAL IN IT
YEAH OR UM MAYBE TO KEEP IT UH EASY AND UH SMALL
OKAY
YEAH BUT
BUT IT'S NOT T T T TOO EXPENSIVE TO PUT A TOUCHSCREEN ON IT
BUT THAT'S YEAH I THINK IT'S MUCH UH TOO EXPENSIVE
UH LIKE A A TO HAVE YEAH MAYBE IT WOULD
YEAH BUT IT'S NOT REACHABLE I THINK TOUCH SCREEN
BECAUSE UH UH REMOTE CONTROLS ARE MOST UH THINGS IN THE HOUSE THAT FALLS DOWN ON THE GROUND AND IT GET OFTEN UH BROKEN
AND WE HAVE TO CARE FOR UH THE STRENGTH OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH
AND IF YOU HAVE A TOUCH SCREEN IN IT IT'S DEFINITELY TOO TOO FRAGILE UH FRAGILE
YEAH
SO
YEAH TOO FRAGILE
YEAH AND A LOTS UH UH LOTS OF KIDS USE IT AND TOUCHSCREEN IS NOT UH KIDS UH
NO
YOU CAN PUT GAMES ON YOUR REMOTE CONTROL
WHATEVER
KID PROOF
YEAH
UH SHOULD YOU PUT IT IN A RECHARGER OR A JUST
AND UH HOW ABOUT THE BATTERIES
UM
OH MAYBE THAT'S A GOOD IDEA JUST TO PUT IT ON YOUR TELEVISION AND JUST S RECHARGE YOU NEVER HAVE TO USE ANY BATTERIES
MA MAYBE A HOME STATION
YEAH
MM YEAH
MAYBE THAT'S A GOOD IDEA BUT YEAH WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE PRICE NOW I THINK
YEAH HOW M HOW MU HOW HOW EXPENSIVE UH IS A NORMAL RECHARGER
YEAH
YEAH I DUNNO
WELL UH HOW MUCH IS YOUR UH STANDARDS UH MOBILE PHONE RECHARGER
I DUNNO
YEAH IF YOU BUY IT UH SEPARATELY FROM YOUR PHONE IT'S PROBABLY EXPENSIVE BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PROJECT UH PROJECTION COSTS ARE FOR SUCH A THING
AH YEAH
MAYBE HAVE UH
UH IF YOU TH LOOK AT THE MARKET IT'S PROBABLY IT'S STILL THE BEST WAY JUST TO PUT BATTERIES IN IT BECAUSE MAYBE IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE
YEAH 'CAUSE WELL
YEAH
BECAUSE UH LOTS OF PEOPLE ARE UH LOSE THEIR REMOTE CONTROL AND DON'T KNOW WHERE IT IS AND NOW YOU CAN PUT IT ALWAYS AT THE SAME PLACE
MAYBE IT'S
YEAH BUT A HOME STATION IS UH A REALLY GOOD IDEA
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
THEREFORE IT'S A GOOD IDEA BUT MAYBE IT'S EXPENSIVE
SELL IT UH SEPARATELY
MAYBE UH USE IT AS A SEPARATE OPTION
YEAH
YOU CAN YEAH YOU CAN BUY IT WITH IT
YEAH BUT I HAVE A MOUSE THAT'S UH UH ALSO UH
RECHARGEABLE
YEAH AND AND YOU JUST HAVE NORMAL BATTERIES THAT YOU CAN RECHARGE AND JUST PUT IT IN THE STATION OR YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR BATTERIES SO
YEAH
OH YEAH
THE OPTION JUST THE OPTION THAT'S COOL
YEAH
UH THE THE ON OFF BUTTON MUST BE ON TOP UH IT HAS TO LAY GOOD IN THE HAND YOU YOU HAVE TO UH
UH I I SET SOMETHING ON PAPER ALREADY SIZE LOOKS UH USABLE UH THE BUTTONS ON USABLE PLACES
YEAH
YEAH
HAS IT BE HAS DOES IT HAS TO B HAVE TO BE UM UH LIKE A DIFFERENT FORM THAN A NORMAL REMOTE CONTROL OR
YEAH I DON'T I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW IF WE
WELL I THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT 'CAUSE WELL YOU CAN DO THE STANDARD WAY BUT THEN YOU WON'T
YOU CAN MAKE IT VERY SPECIAL TO CREATE OUR OWN UM LOOKS BUT IT'S VERY HARD TO
YEAH
N UH IF IF WE WANT TO MAKE IT SPECIAL WE PROBABLY HAVE TO DO A LOT OF TESTING IF IT REALLY WORKS
NAH
WELL YOU CAN UM
SO IF YOU HAVE A CLEAR BUTTON WITH AN GOOD ICON ON IT IT SHOULD BE CLEAR AS WELL
HAVE UH THE BASIC THINGS ON THE SAME PLACE LIKE ON OFF BUTTON ON TOP AND THE T. V. CHANNELS ONE TWO THREE FOUR AS A BLOCK
SO IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT PLACE IT IS ON THE REMOTE CONTROL I THINK SO YOU CAN DO SOMETHING UNIQUE WITH THAT
BUT THE REST IS UH YOU DON'T USE THAT OFTEN
AND THEN THE VOLUME UH OBVIOUSLY ON T ON TOP SO YOU CAN SEE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
BUT N YEAH BUT UH I BASICALLY WHEN I'M WATCHING T. V. I'M JUST USING LIKE FIVE BUTTONS OR SO SO
YEAH
AND WHAT WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT TOO IS UH UH BUTTONS THAT YOU USE OFTEN ARE UM MAYBE UH LIKE WHEN YOU FOLD IT OPEN
WHEN YOU HAVE IT CLOSED YOU CAN STILL UH DO THE TH THE FUNCTIONS
UH ON ON TOP ARE THE THE BASIC OPTIONS ON TOP AND IF YOU FOLD IT OPEN
YEAH YEAH WHAT PAUL ALREADY SAID
YEAH JUST FOR THE T. V. AND JUST THE NORMAL FUNCTION THAT'S FINE
YEAH YEAH
BUT MAYBE IT'S
THAT'S WHAT I MEANT
YEAH
MAYBE IT'S VERY HARD TO TO MAKE IT FOLD OPEN AND TO L LOOK LIKE IT'S VERY UH UH WHAT'S IT'S CALLED
MM
IF YOU IF IF YOU MAKE TO FOLD OPEN IT'S OR ALSO AN UH THE STRENGTH UH IS NOT S AS GOOD AS A NORMAL UH REMOTE CONTROL
MAYBE IT'S HARD T
UH
NO THAT'S RIGHT
SO MAYBE WE HAVE TO TO UH KEEP IT LIKE MM A SQUARE JUST NORMAL REMOTE CONTROL
OKAY BUT YEAH
JUST THINK ABOUT IT
THERE'S SOME MORE THINGS
WE HAVE UH ANOTHER THIRTY MINUTES SO THEN WE'RE GOING TO MEET AGAIN
WE HAVE TO CLOSE THIS UH TO FINISH THIS UH MEETING SO
SO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE TO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH
DO I NEED TO THINK AS A USER A AS A A A ONLY THE LOOKS AND THE
UM FOR M FOR ME UH THE MARKETING EXPERT THE USER REQUIREMENTS UH SPECIFICATION
NO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO WITH IT
YEAH EVERYTHING
ALSO FROM A USER BUT ALL THESE THINGS TOGETHER
YEAH I THINK THIS IF YOU YOU HAVE TO N KNOW IF IT'S FOR S A T. V. A D. V. D. PLAYER ALL THAT THINGS
OKAY
YEAH IT'S ALSO ABOUT STRENGTH AND UH FOR EVERYTHING UH
YEAH I ALSO WROTE DOWN SOME STUFF THAT YOU WANT ON A
YEAH NO MAYBE NOT NOT UH THAT'S NOT A F THAT'S SOMETHING FOR FOR FOR YEAH
THAT'S NOT FOR YOU
TECHNICAL FUN FU
OKAY
JUST IF WHAT'S IN THE MARKET WHAT'S NORMAL UH WHAT KIND OF UH BUTTONS DO YOU HAVE
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO WITH YOUR REMOTE CONTROL WHAT DO YOU NEED ON YOUR REMOTE CONTROL
I ALREADY WROTE SOME DOWN SOME IDEAS
YEAH IT'S ALRIGHT
YEP
YEAH JUST IS THAT OKAY
OKAY
YEP
OKAY
OKAY
THERE'S ALREADY A DOCUMENT IN THE
FOLDER ABOUT IT
YEAH ME TOO
SO SEE YOU IN THIRTY MINUTES
OKAY WELL DONE

OH SORRY ABOUT THAT I JUST ESCAPE THIS ONE
HOW DO I ESCAPE THIS
WHAT
HOW DO I I ESCAPE THIS S UH PRESENTATION
UH LEFT
SO
UH
AH OKAY
AND SHOW SORRY
OKAY SO LET'S HAVE A LOOK S AT THIS ONE
JUST YEAH
UM
OKAY SO THE F THE F THE POINTS WE HAD LAST MEETING WAS THE UM SHOULD BE A UNIV UH UNIVERSAL REMOTE CONTROL NO
IT'S IT'S STILL THE SAME
UM SO YEAH IT STILL HAS TO BE UH F A R A REMOTE CONTROL FOR KIDS AND ELDERLY
THAT'S I UH S I JUST GOT A EMAIL FROM THE FROM THE PERSONAL COACH AND IT SHOULD BE A T. V. REMOTE CONTROL ONLY
SO HAVE YOU CHANGED THAT PART
OKAY
OKAY
ALL THESE POINTS UH WE HAVE TO
BUT UH THERE'S ANOTHER POINT
THE UM UH THE MAIN
YOU ALL KNOW THEM
LOOK AT
UH PEOPLE OF INTEREST OF THIS COMPANY ARE FORTY PLUS PEOPLE
SO THEY'RE OLD AND NOT YOUNGER PEOPLE
'SPECIALLY OLD PEOPLE MAYBE BI BIGGER BUTTONS OR SOMETHING I DUNNO
SO WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT AS WELL
YEAH OKAY
UH SO
SO YEAH THAT'S IT SO JUST YOU CAN DO YOUR PRESENTATION FOR UH
WHICH ONE FIRST
OKAY
OH IT DOESN'T MATTER JUST START WITH THE
OKAY
MM
UH
FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS YEAH
UM I'VE
WAIT
OKAY
WELL MY NAME IS JENS DAMMAN BUT WE'RE IN A GROUP AND I I WILL START IT
UH AND UH F AND FURTHERMORE I UH SURFED THE O THE OTHER SITE
UH I THINK YOU'VE UH READ IT TOO
USED A MARKETING REPORT ON UH THE SITE
IT'S ONLY FOR YOU
I I DIDN'T READ I READ IT SO IT'S NOT FOR ME I DIDN'T GET IT UH ANYWAY
YOU DIDN'T READ IT
YES
NO I DIDN DON'T THING WE GOT IT
OKAY IT WAS UH UH UH UM UM A REPORT ABOUT UH AN EXPERIMENT WITH UH A LOT OF USERS
OH OKAY I I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO GET IT
YEAH
AND UH THEY HAD A LOT OF FINDINGS IN THEIR REPORT UH WITH STATISTICAL UH UH UH THING UH WITH STATISTICAL UH PROOF
SO I UM I HAD THREE PAGES WITH FINDINGS AND SEV A LOT OF UH A LOT OF FINDINGS
UH SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE USERS FIND UH MOST REMOTE CONTROLS UGLY
SO WE CAN USE THIS UH TO UH CREATE OUR OWN REMOTE CONTROL
UH EIGHTY PERCENT OF USERS WOULD SPEND WHEN UH A REMOTE CONTROL WILL L UH LOOK FANCY
YEAH I THINK UH UH THAT'S A LOT SO WE HAVE TO MAKE A BEAUTIFUL REMOTE CONTROL
BECAUSE YOUNGER PEOPLE ARE MORE CRITICAL UH ABOUT UH UH WHERE THEY SPEND THEIR MONEY MONEY AT
I THINK THIS FITS UH AT THE UH WHAT WHAT UH MICHAEL SAID ABOUT UH OLDER PEOPLE
OLDER PEOPLE WILL UH SPEND MORE MONEY UH FOR UH SOMETHING UH UH WHAT'S GOOD
UH SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT UH SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE USERS SAY THEY ZAP A LOT
WELL OKAY THAT'S UH NORMAL
BUT THAT'S ONE OF OUR REQUIREMENTS
I THINK UH WE WE HAVE TO MAKE UH GOOD ZAP BUTTONS
THE LAST POINT IS QUITE AN INTERESTING
UM MARTIJN ALR ALREADY SAID IT
AND UH MAYBE OUR UH FOLD OPEN SYSTEM IS IS A GOOD ONE BUT
YES FIFTY PERCENT OF USERS SAY THEY ONLY USE TEN PERCENT OF THE BUTTONS
SO IF WE
YEAH
I DON'T THINK IT'S UH
YEAH WE SHOULD HAVE THE TEN PERCENT ON THE ON THE TOP THEN YOU'RE YOU'RE
REACHABLE
THAT THAT'S A GOOD ONE
YEAH THE TEN PERCENT ON THE TOP YEAH
UM UH PAGE TWO
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE SAID ABOUT UM MAYBE A HOME STATION FOR UH FOR IT UH TO UH RECHARGE THE BATTERIES OR SOMETHING
REMOTE CONTROLS ARE OFTEN LOST SOMEWHERE IN THE ROOM
YEAH
UH YOU MUST FIND IT UH QUICKLY
UH I THOUGHT MO MAYBE WE COULD MAKE A CLAP SYSTEM SO WHEN YOU CLAP YOUR HANDS IT WILL BEEP OR SOMETHING
UH
SO REMOTE CONTROL BEEPS WHEN YOU CLICK THAT BUTTON ON THE HOME STATION
MAYBE JUST A BUTTON ON THE HOME STATION
YEAH WE CAN UH COMBINE THAT
OKAY YEAH
UH IT TAKES TOO MUCH TIME TO LEARN HOW TO USE A R NEW REMOTE CONTROL
UH I THINK WE MUST T UH TAKE A LOOK AT THIS
IT'S ONLY UH TH THIRTY FOUR OF THE THIRTY FOUR PERCENT
BECAUSE IF WE MAKE A HA WHOLE NEW PRODUCT OUR OWN STYLE WE WE C UH THIS IS SO DIFFICULT UH A DIFFICULTY I THINK
BUT IT'S UH A TOUGH ONE
I DON'T WE WE HAVEN'T UH WE MUSTN'T LOOK TOO MUCH AT UH THE LAST POINT
UH NEXT REMOTE CONTROLS ARE BAD FOR R. S. I.
YEAH BUT ONLY IF THEY ZAP A LOT AND THEY WATCH OVER FIVE HOURS T. V. OR SOMETHING
AND UH AN L. C. D. ON THE REMOTE CONTROL
UH THE LAST UH EXPERIMENT UH WAS ABOUT GADGETS LIKE UH SPEECH RECOGNITION
OKAY LAST PAGE
WE ALREADY THOUGHT ABOUT THAT
WE DIDN'T UH THINK ABOUT THAT ALREADY
UM UH THEY FINALLY HAD A CONCLUSION THAT YOUNGER PEOPLE UM UH UNDER AN AGE OF F FORTY FIVE ARE UH MORE INTERESTED IN NEW FEATURES
AND BUT THEY'RE MORE CRITICAL
AND THEY WANT TO KEEP THE OLD UH THINGS THE OLD THINGS
BUT UH THEY UH THEY DON'T WANT TO UH HAVE A LOT OF UH NEW FEATURES BECAUSE THEY'RE IN THEIR OLD UH THINKING WAY
AND OLDER PEOPLE UH WANT TO SPEND UH MORE MONEY
SO WE HAVE UH A NEW UH AGE OF FORTY PLUS
BUT Y BUT YOU BUT YOU ALREADY SAID THAT THE UH COMPANY WAS ABOUT UH FORTY PLUS UH CLIENTS
SO YEAH SO WE JUST CAN SKIP THE L. C. D. R ON THE REMOTE CONTROL BECAUSE
PEOPLE
UM THEN
I I THINK WE CAN SPEAK UH WE CAN SKIP SPEECH RECOGNITION UH DIRECTLY BECAUSE IT'S NOT REACHABLE FOR TWENTY FIVE EUROS
YEAH
IT'S TOO OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
I HAD A QUESTION ABOUT
I HAVE MY PERSONAL UH PREFERENCE
BUT IT'S ALREADY OUT OF THE QUESTION THIS
OKAY THAT'S NOT VERY GOOD BECAUSE I THOUGHT ABOUT TELEVISION D. V. D. PLAYER STEREO AND V. C. R.
UM MY POINT IS WELL I IF WE MA UH MAKE A A REMOTE UH CONTROL FOR ONLY TELEVISION
BUT IT'S THE EXERCISE
I THINK IT'S HARD TO UH SELL IT FOR TWENTY FIVE EUROS
BECAUSE IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE
YEAH PROBABLY
YEAH ONLY ONLY FOR TELEVISION UH ON THE MARKET YOU CAN NOW BUY FOR TWENTY EUROS A REMOTE CONTROL FOR EVERYTHING
AND WE ONLY MAKE IT FOR TELEVISION SO WE MI MM WE M MUST MADE IT MAKE IT UH VERY SPECIAL
YEAH BUT GOOD USABILITY SO YOU CAN USE IT
UH IT MUST BE SIMPLE BECAUSE UH OUR THE THE ELDERLY PEOPLE UH NEEDS TO USE IT
OKAY I TOLD ABOUT THE HOME STATION
AND WE PUT THE FASHION IN ELECTRONICS
WE WE HAVE TO MAKE A A NEW PRODUCT
WE HAVE TO BE UM YEAH
AND I I FOUND A MOTTO
AND THAT'S UH THE MOTTO WE ARE UH REFERENCED TO UH FOR OUR UH OUR STYLE
ONE OF A KIND I THINK
SO IT HAS TO LOOK UH UH UH UNIQUE BUT
UNIQUE
THE COMPANY IS ABOUT OUR UH TH TH THEIR OWN FASHION THEIR OWN STYLE
YEAH I RECKON
YEAH
BUT OLD PEOPLE ARE NOT LOOKING FOR THAT
UH I THINK MM
NOT REALLY
YEAH
YEAH
I THINK THE MAIN THING IS THE USABILITY THAT'S WHERE WE CAN UH MAKE IT A SPECIAL PRODUCT
UH
YEAH
YEAH TO K TO KEEP IT SIMPLE WHEN YOU SORRY I THOUGHT ABOUT IT YES
YEAH
OKAY
BUT UH WE ALSO HAVE TO STAND OUT 'CAUSE THERE ARE ALREADY LIKE YOU SAID SO MANY CONTROLS OUT THAT SUPPORT LOT OF STUFF
SO MAKE IT JUST A DIFFERENT COLOUR OR DIFFERENT SHAPE SO
BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE BETTER USABILITY AND STAND OUT BY JUST LOOKS OF IT
OKAY
YEAH
OKAY THIS WAS UH MY PRESENTATION
THANKS
OKAY
I DON'T YEAH
YOU CAN ASK SOME QUESTIONS OR SOMETHING
SO PAUL YOU CAN DO THE NEXT ONE IF YOU WANT
YEAH WELL
OKAY
UH
IT'S ON THE ON THE UH NET NET UH THING ISN'T IT
THERE IT IS
OKAY
TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS DESIGN
UH THE WAY I WANT TO KEEP IT SIMPLE IS TO USE THE SEN UH STANDARD
BUT UM WE HAVE ELDERLY PEOPLE SO WE NEED TO KEEP IT SIMPLE
OKAY WELL SO WE HAVE S MM UH BROAD AUDIENCE
ISN'T THAT ISN'T TRUE ANYMORE
NOT TOO FULL LIKE UH JENS ALREADY SAID ONLY TEN PERCENT IS BEING USED
SO STANDARDISED UH METHODS LIKE UH ON ALL UH REMOTE CONTROLS
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK OF ONLY THE NUMBERS AND THE ON OFF BUTTON OR
YEAH I HAVE IT ON THE NEXT PAGE
SO IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH TIME TO FIGURE OUT UH HOW TO USE IT
UH AN ICON ON IT OR TEXT ON IT SO IT'S VERY CLEAR WHAT THAT BUTTONS DOES
UM SO THE OPTIONS THAT WE PUT ON THERE SHOULD BE EASY TO USE AND 'CAUSE YOU HAVE MORE ROOM THEN AND FOR ELDERLY PEOPLE BIG BUTTONS
BUT YES UH BASIC FUNCTIONS LIKE NUMBERS AND THAT SORT OF STUFF
OKAY
UM A WAY TO FIND OUT UH WHAT PEOPLE USE IS MAYBE JUST TO USE UH QUESTIONNAIRES ON THE INTERNET OR
JUST ASK SOME RANDOM PEOPLE ELDERLY PEOPLE WHAT THEY USE WHAT THEY WANT ON A REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH
TO FIND OUT
BUT THERE IS ALREADY IN A
OF FUNCTIONS I COULD THINK OF
UH VOLUME CHANNELS THE THE BASIC ACCORDING TO
ONE DONE
UH TEXT SERVICE OPTIONS
JUST ONE TWO THREE ETCETERA
BUT IF YOU COULD MAKE A NEW OPTION THAT YOU JUST HAVE TO PRESS ONE BUTTON AND YOU GET ON YOUR
I ALWAYS LOOK UP THE SAME UM PAGES ON TEXT AND ALWAYS HAVE TO CLICK THE NUMBER
AND I FOUND AN UH COULD I THINK OF FAVOURITES
UM BASIC ON OFF
OKAY
YEAH BUT THEN YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER WHAT FAVOURITE IS WHAT CHANNEL
SO YOU MIGHT AS WELL REMEMBER THE NUMBER
OR NOT
NO Y
IT'S A GOOD IDEA BUT
MAYBE I MAYBE IT'S TOO COMPLICATED BUT NOT SURE
WELL IT'S IT WAS JUST A THOUGHT
SO I'M I U I WOULD FIND IT HANDY I THINK WHEN YOU JUST PRESS ONE BUTTON AND YOU GET ON SIX SIX SIX
BUT UM HOW CAN YOU REMEMBER WHAT UH CHANNEL UH CONNECTS TO WHAT FAVOURITE BUTTON
YEAH OKAY
JUST NUMBERS
SO SWITCH TO CHANNEL SIX
UH A REMOTE CONTROL JUST SENDS COMMANDS BASICS COMMANDS TO UH THE TELEVISION
WELL UH WHAT I WAS READING ON THE PAGE
AND IF YOU MAKE FAVOURITES IT CAN SAY SIX SIX SIX IN A ROW
THAT CAN BE IN THE IN THE
SO UH BUTTON SIX SAYS SAYS SIX
UH
YEAH
BUT UH UH FOR A USER TO TO REMEMBER IF I PRESS THAT BUTTON IT GOES TO THAT CHANNEL
YEAH OKAY
WELL IF YOU SAID A FAVOURITE
LIKE FAVOURITE ONE AND
YEAH BUT ISN'T IT HARD TO REMEMBER
UH MAYB FOR ME IT'S IF I USE MY TELEPHONE I NEVER USE THOSE BUTTONS TO TO TO CALL SH NEVER
WELL I
MM AS AS HARD AS
NEVER
OH
NO NEITHER DO I
OH ARE YOU
SO AND
OKAY NOW M MAYBE NOT
IF I DON'T DO IT MAYBE OLD PEOPLE
THEY DON'T LIKE NEW FEATURES
SO MAYBE NOT
NO MAYBE ELDERLY PEOPLE UH
RIGHT
YEAH I DUNNO
MM-HMM
UM WELL PLAY PAUSE
I DUNNO IF THAT'S USABLE WHEN
IT'S NOT IT'S STILL NOT IT'S NOT ANYMORE N UH
RIGHT ON OFF
I DUNNO MISS DID I MISS ANY OTHER BUTTONS BASIC BUTTONS
NOT ANYMORE FOR T. V.
UM
I COULDN'T THINK OF ANY OTHER 'SPECIALLY NOT FOR T. V.
NO THAT'S THE ONLY TH THE ONLY THING YOU NEED
JUST ON THE FRONT AS WELL
IS
UH UH THE P UH NEXT AND PREVIOUS
PREVIOUS I KNOW BUT NEXT CHANNEL
I DON'T THI
JUST THE CHANNEL UM UH WHAT I MEAN IS UH
FORWARD
BUT UH UM THERE'S ALSO A BUTTON TO UH GO TO THE CHANNEL YOU'VE BEEN BEFORE
LI LIKE A WEB BROWSER SO OH OKAY
SIX SEVEN EIGHT OR FIVE
JUST VERY SIMPLE
LIKE A WEB BROWSER BACK BUTTON
UM I DUNNO
I DON'T HAVE UH I DID
UH YEAH I KNOW WHAT IT IS BUT I THINK IT'S ALL TOO DIFFICULT FOR OLD PEOPLE
NO
UH
YEAH I DON'T THINK YOU USE THAT
Y ONLY WHEN YOU WANT TO GO TO
YEAH OKAY
YEAH JUST USE UH WHEN YOU WANNA SWITCH BETWEEN CHANNELS ALL THE TIME
NORMALLY YOU CAN PRESS ONE ZERO OR
AND HOW DO YOU WANT TO UH DO IT LIKE IF YOU HAVE A CHANNEL ABOVE TEN
YEAH
SO YOU HAVE THAT UH
YEAH I THINK UM F ESPECIALLY FOR OLDER PEO ELDERLY PEOPLE USE STANDARD BUTTONS
A TEN PLUS OR
YEAH THE TEN PLUS BUTTON
JUST UH ONE ONE PRESSING OR QUICKLY AFTER EACH OTHER
OKAY
TO JUST KEEP IT SIMPLE AND STANDARD UH FEATURES
MAYBE THE ELDERLY PEOPLE
YEAH W WOULDN'T IT BE A PROBLEM TO UH BECAUSE YOU H HAVE TO BE FAST ENOUGH
BUT YOU CAN HAVE A BUTTON THAT SAYS UM
UH YEAH MAYB BUT I THINK THAT'S IN THE T. V. AS WELL
THAT'S HOW THE UH THE T. V. T. V. HANDLES IT
IT GETS SOME SECONDS
TWO TWO ST TWO STRIPES
SO YOU HAVE UH LIKE A FIVE SECONDS PERIOD TO PRESS THOSE TWO BUTTONS
YEAH IT'S IT'S NO IT'S NOT A
OH OKAY
YEAH
YEAH BUT THAT'S TH MM
IT'S THE T. V. WHO DEPENDS THAT IT MUST BE TWO SECONDS OR THREE SECONDS OR ONE SECOND THAT YOU MUST UH TYPE ONE OR TWO
IT'S NOT A REMOTE CONTROL UH UH THAT UM UH MAKES THE T. V. UM DO ONE TWO
IT'S WHAT PAUL SAYS
OKAY
SO WE HAVE A A PERIOD OF I DUNNO FIVE SECONDS TO PRESS THOSE BUTTONS
SO IF YOU HAVE A UNIVERSAL T. V. CONTROLLER YOU NEEDED ONE BUTTON THAT HAS TWO UH STRIPES
AND THAT AND NOT FOR ELDERLY PEOPLE TO LOOK ONE TWO UH PRESS AND AIM AND
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
BUT DO WE STILL NEED A TWO LEVEL REMOTE CONTROL
BECAUSE IF WE ONLY HAVE THAT L ONLY F NO
IT'S ONLY FOR TELEVISION NOW
MOST THINGS IN MODERN T. V. S ARE ALSO ON THE MENU
SO YOU ALSO NEED A MENU BUTTON
UH I JUST THOUGHT OF ANOTHER ONE
AND THEN UH NAVIGATION UH
SO I I DON'T THINK SO
NO
YEAH
BUT WE CAN INTEGRATE THAT WITH VOLUME AND PREVIOUS AND NEXT SO YOU HAVE
YEAH
SO
LIKE UM UH M MAYBE UH SWITCH CHANNELS AND UH VOLUME AND K THAT KIND OF THINGS AND UH THE MENU BUTTON
BECAUSE YOU N ALMOST NEVER USE MENU BUTTON
I I THINK YOU HA REALLY HAVE TO DIVIDE BETWEEN FUNCTIONS YOU OFTEN USE
FOUR ARROWS
YEAH OKAY BUT UM
YOU'LL ALSO HAVE TO USE A MUTE BUTTON TO TO
MAYBE IT'S STILL STILL A GOOD IDEA I'M NOT SURE
YES
DON'T THINK SO
YEAH A MUTE BUTTON
MAYBE NOT I DON'T KNOW WHERE WHERE YOU HAVE TO PUT IT
AND LATER WE CAN D UH DO THE DESIGN
YEAH WELL THAT'S THAT'S I THINK THAT'S THE LAYERS THAT PRODUCE
NOW I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S UH WHAT TO PUT ON
WHAT WE'RE GONNA USE
YEAH
YEAH
THAT'S RIGHT
OKAY
OKAY
UH USING THE STANDARDS BASIC
OKAY UH NOW MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES
UM I THINK THAT WE SHOULD STAND OUT UH UNIQUE BEING UNIQUE WITH THE DESIGN
SO WHEN YOU ARE IN THE SHOP AND YOU SEE OUR T. V. CONTROLLER HANGING THAT IT STANDS OUT
SO WE HAVE TO I DUNNO UH MAKE A DIFFERENT SHAPE THAN USUAL
NOT JUST IN IN THE ROW WHEN YOU SEE
ALL THE SAME UH REMOTE CONTROLS
DOES IT HAVE TO BE UH IT HAS TO BE UH WITH DIFFERENT COLOURS OR
YEAH
UM
DIFFERENT COLOURS UM
I DUNNO
MAYBE WE CAN GIVE IT OUT IN DIFFERENT COLOURS
YOU CAN CHOOSE BLUE OR YELLOW OR
IT'S LIKE A IMAC OR SOMETHING
JUST TO MAKE IT
MM-HMM
YEAH
WELL WHY NOT
OR YEAH
THAT'S UH FASHION
THAT'S FA THAT'S FANCY
IT'S ONLY TWENTY FIVE EUROS
BUT IT LOOKS CHEAP AS WELL BECAUSE IT'S A SMALL THING
IT LOOKS VERY CHEAP IF YOU MAKE IT
WELL MAYBE YOU CAN LOOK AT UH MOBILE PHONES
OH
OH YOU JUST I DUNNO WHAT HAPPENED
WHO
JUST
YEAH WE HAVE TO LOOK AT MOBILE PHONES THAT'S RIGHT
YOU THINK YOU CAN'T MAKE A T. V. CONTROLLER TOO SMALL 'CAUSE THEN YOU WILL ALWAYS LO ALWAYS LOSE IT
AND WELL BASICALLY ARE THE SAME JUST A BIT SMALLER
THEY THEY'RE UH DESIGNED VERY WELL
YEAH
YEAH
BUT UH WELL I THINK THAT'S A GOOD EXAMPLE
OKAY
OKAY
IS IT FIN ARE YOU FINISHED
OKAY WE HURRY UP A BIT BECAUSE OTHERWISE WE WON'T MAKE IT
WELL UH YEAH I I'M FINISHED
OKAY SORRY
I THINK WE DISCUSSED EVERYTHING
OKAY
WELL THE WORKING DESIGN
THE METHOD I USED IS UH SEARCH THE WEB
JUST THE WEB PAGE PROVIDED
UM
UM BASICALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU PRESS A BUTTON UH THEN A CIRCUIT GETS CLOSED BY PRESSING THE BUTTON UH LIKE A SWITCH
BASICALLY I'M I'M NOT VERY TECHNICAL UH UH EDUCATED BUT UH I COULD FIGURE IT OUT
SO LIKE YOU PRESS A ONE THAT CIRCUIT IS CLOSED AND UH THEN THE CHIP PRODUCES A PATTERN
AND BY CLOSING THAT CERTAIN CIRCUIT THE CHIP KNOWS UH WHAT BU BUTTON IS PRESSED
THAT'S UN UH INVISIBLE
UM AND THE LIGHT EMITTING DIODE IS UH PRODUCING INFRARED LIGHT
LIKE A MORSE CODE TO UH AND AND SENDS THAT TO THE UH L. E. D.
THAT'S THE UH LIGHT EMITTING DIODE I THINK
TO THE HUMAN EYE
AND UH TRANSMIT THAT UH TO THE T. V.
BECAUSE INFRARED IS NOT VISIBLE
HOWEVER IT HAS ALSO AN UH A VISIBLE UH DIODE THAT'S UH BLINKING RED IF YOU LOOK IN IT
AND THAT'S UH ANOTHER DIODE I BELIEVE
SO THAT'S ER UH DO TWO DIFFERENT THINGS BUT
MM-HMM
SO WE WE ALSO HAVE TO HAVE A LED LI LED LIGHT ON IT
YEAH
I I THINK SO
I I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S THE SAME THING
UH J IS AIN'T IT JUST TO TO INDICATE THAT IT'S TRANSMITTING
YEAH IT'S I THINK IT'S USABLE
YEAH THAT'S ACTIVE
OR JUST A GREEN ONE BECAUSE IT'S IF YOU USE IT IT'S GREEN OR THE RED IT'S R GREEN
YEAH
YEAH
SO
YEAH
MAYBE UH
IT'S NOT UH
I I THINK IT'S IN THE CASE THAT IT'S ACTIVE
SO
YEAH WHEN YOU PRESS IT
BUT IF YOU
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
I IT'S IT'S JUST UH THE THE
TWO
RED'S L SHOWS UP LIKE SOMETHING'S WRONG AND GREEN IS LIKE IT'S OKAY YOU PRESS THE BUTTON
MM
SO
MA ON ON MOST ON MOST UH UH REMOTE CONTROLS IT'S RED
YEAH I DUNNO
MAYBE DEPENDS ON UH
YEAH I KNOW
OKAY WE MAKE IT RED
YES
YEAH
SO I KNOW
BUT MAYBE WELL WE DON'T HAVE TO MAKE IT RED
MAYBE INTEGRATE IT IN THE DESIGN AS WELL
UH THAT'S COOL
YOU HAVE TO THE WHOLE THE WHOLE UH REMOTE CONTROL BECOMES UH GREEN IF YOU PRESS THE BUTTONS
I I THINK UH THE BATTERIES WILL BE UH A LITTLE YEAH OKAY
UH MAYBE
UH OH MAYBE IT'S IT IS WOULD AN E NO
JUST UH
EMPTY
NO WE HAVE A RECHARGER IN IT SO
OH
IF WE CAN STILL MAKE THAT THEN
IT'S JUST TO INDICATE SOMETHING'S ON
YEAH BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE RED
YEAH
THAT IT'S WORKING
YEAH
THAT IT'S NOT NOT THE BATTERIES ARE LOW
IT'S IT'S NOT VERY IMPORTANT SO YEAH
YEAH
GREEN OR RED OR WHATEVER IT IS COOL
BUT IT'S COOL IF IT WAS GREEN
JUST TO INDICATE IT'S WORKING
YEAH I KNOW
SO MM
WE HAVE TO REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT PATTERNS ARE USED SO WE CAN UH O ON THE OTHERWISE IT WON'T WORK
SO THAT IT CAN BE USED WITH ALL THE T. V. S
SO WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT PATTERNS ARE USED TO YOU KNOW TO MAKE IT UNIVERSAL
AND UH THE RECEPTOR IN THE T. V. SENSES THE PATTERN
SO WE HAVE TO UH MAKE BUTTONS FOR THAT AS WELL TO MAKE IT UH
SO WE HAVE TO MAKE A CHIP THAT PRODUCES PATTERNS TO Y YOU KNOW TO YEAH
NO
THAT ARE WORKING
I I UH THE CHIP UM UH IS PRODUCING THE PATTERN
OKAY
AN AUTOMATICALLY SEARCH FUNCTION FOR EACH TELEVISION OR SOMETHING
YEAH OR I DUNNO HOW IT'S UH EXACTLY HOW IT WORKS
IT WASN'T EXPLAINED THERE
WELL I I USE A UNIVERSAL UH REMOTE CONTROL AND LIST OF ALL THE T. V. S YOU HAVE ETCETERA
AND YOU HAVE TO PUT IN A NUMBER SO IT WORKS ON YOUR T. V.
UH I KNO
YEAH
OKAY
OH I HAVE A MODERN ONE
AND UH UH UH AFTER UH A SHORT TIME THE TELEVISION TURNS OFF
AND THE MODERN ONE YOU YOU UH YOU TYPE UH SEARCH AND THE LED BEGAN TO BLINK BLINK BLINK
AND THEN YOU KNOW OH IT IT'S THE RIGHT ONE
AND YOU CAN STOP IT AND THEN IT'S OKAY
AH OKAY
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO SEARCH FOR YOUR TELEVISION OR YOUR CODE
IT UH SEARCH UH THE PATTERN FOR ITSELF
OKAY
SO IT UH WE HAVE TO MAKE A A S A BIT MORE INTELLIGENT CHIP THAN THE STANDARD ONE
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO YEAH
OKAY YEAH
OKAY SO WE USE THAT
YES
YEP
I JUST SAY CAN YOU S JUST SAY IT AGAIN BECAUSE I WAS JUST LOOKING THERE'S JUST A SHORT
UH OKAY
THAT'S UH WHEN THE CIRCUIT IS CLOSED IT PRODUCES THE PATTERN
BUT UH MA BASICALLY FOR UH BRANDS OF T. V. THESE PATTERNS ARE DIFFERENT
WELL UH Y YOU HAVE THIS CHIP
YEAH
MM-HMM
SO LIKE WHEN YOU PRESS A ONE ON ONE T. V. IT GO GO TO ONE
AND ON THE OTHER T. V. IT WON'T WORK BASICALLY
AND UH BY D UH THAT CAN BE DONE BY UH JUST UH CHA YEAH CHANGING THIS PATTERN ALL THE TIME
AND UM
SO UH BASICALLY WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS UH GET THESE PATTERNS RIGHT
YEAH
CHANGING THE SIGNAL
AND WHEN IT'S UH SWITCHED OFF YOU CAN PUSH A BUTTON AS UH IT'S WORKING NOW SO AND THEN HE SAVES THAT SETTING AND THEN UM IT'S WORKING
WHAT HE'S DOING WHEN HE'S CONFIGURING THIS PATTERN THIS CHIP UH IS TRYING TO SWITCH OFF THE TELEVISION
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S THE RIGHT UH OPTION
OKAY
YEAH THAT'S A BIT TECHNICAL AND I HADN'T I W I WAS A LITTLE SHORT ON TIME
WELL UH THE COMPONENTS
UM THAT'S CONNECTING TO ALL THE COMPONENTS
UM THE ENERGY SOURCE IS UH THE BATTERY BASICALLY
UM BUT I THINK I UNDERSTAND IT
YEAH
BECAUSE IT HAS TO BE FED WITH ENERGY
UH THE SUBCOMPONENT IS UH W
OKAY
SO BASICALLY WHEN YOU PRESS A BUTTON A SWITCH GET CLOSED
I I THINK IT IS UH THE BUTTON PRESSED
UM THAT'S CONNECTING TO A CHIP
SO THE CHIP KNOWS WHAT BUTTON YOU PRESSED
I DIDN DIDN'T PUT THE DESCRIPTION BY THIS ONE
TH THIS IS A NORMAL BULB
SO THE NORMAL FLASHING LIGHT
AND THE CHIP SENDS OUT UH THE PATTERN TO THE INFRARED BULB
OKAY
SO THAT'S THE LED L. E. D.
YEAH
BUT THIS ONE IS PRODUCING INFRARED LIGHT THAT'S INVISIBLE
YEAH AND THIS IS A LED TOO
AND THIS ONE IS PRODUCING NORMAL LIGHT
YEAH OKAY
NOT A LED LIGHT BUT AS A NORMAL ONE
SO WE CAN MAKE THE NORMAL ONE ALSO A NORMAL LIGHT
YEAH
TO FLASH UP YOUR
UH IF YOU IF YOU USE THE BUTTONS UH BOTH OF THEM WORKS
BUT ONE YOU CAN'T SEE AND ONE INDICATES THAT YOU USE A BUTTON
YEAH
YEAH PRESU YEAH YEAH YEAH
BECAUSE UH WHEN YOU BUTTON PRESS A BUTTON AND IT DOESN'T WORK IT CAN BASICALLY IF THE BATTERY IS LOW IT WON'T WORK
SO YOU HAVE TO INDICATE THAT IT'S
YEAH AND
YEAH
MAYBE YOU HAVE TO UH PUT UH A SMALL LIGHT AROUND THE BUTTON YOU PUSH
SO YOU SEE GREEN IF YOU PUSH THAT BUTTON
HUH THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
MM I THINK IT'S UNNECESSARY POWER UH YOU USE THEN
YEAH BUT IF YOU U IF YOU DO THAT YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE UH SENDING A SIGNAL
AND IT'S YOU ALSO KNOW WHICH BUTTON YOU P
NO Y YEAH
OKAY
BUT THEN HAVE TO BE ON THE IN THE ALL UH REMOTE CONTROL HAVE TO BE LEDS
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
BUT IT
EVERYWHERE IN THE R
YOU GOT STILL ONE LED
BUT DOES IT MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE FOR THE ENERGY YOU USE
NO I DON'T THINK SO BUT YEAH I IT IT WILL LOOK DIFFERENT AND I THINK WE NEED TO FIND SOMETHING ELSE
YEAH
THAT LOOKS DIFFERENT YEAH
HMM
'CAUSE OTHERWISE WE WILL JUST MAKE ANOTHER STANDARD AND OUR UH MOTTO ALSO IS
IS LEDS UH BENEATH THE THE BUTTONS
YEAH W AROUND THE BUTTONS OR IN THE BUTTONS EVEN
YEAH OKAY
OR OR M MAYBE ON TOP OF THE A GREEN LIGHT IS FLASHING OR
YOU HAVE YOUR FINGER OVER THE BUTTON
YEAH BUT MM LIKE WHEN YOU PUSH IT N N YEAH
SO YOU CAN SEE YEAH
YEAH THEN THEN WON'T THEN YOU WON'T SEE IT
IT MUST BE AROUND IT THEN
NOT NOT NOT NOT HERE BUT HERE
YEAH THEN YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
THERE
MAYBE UH
THE SAME AS A TELEPHONE OR A MOBILE PHONE OR WHAT DO YOU MEAN
IF YOU PUSH
UH ON A MOBILE PHONE IN THE DARK UH
YEAH WE'RE THINKING ABOUT IT
EVERYTHING LIGHTS UP
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
IT LIGHTS UP
EVERYTHING LIGHTS UP
WHY AIN'T THAT ON A REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH
IT IT ONLY TAKES A L A LITTLE ENERGY AND IT'S NOT THAT MUCH
YEAH IF UH A MOBILE PHONE A PHONE CAN DO IT IT'S
OKAY
YEAH
IT'S F YEAH
MAYBE THAT'S A GOOD IDEA FOR OLD PEOPLE AS WELL
YEAH I IF YOU'RE IN THE DARK YOU CAN'T SEE THE REMOTE
MM-HMM
FOUR LED
IT'S ONLY FEW LEDS
ONLY FOUR OR SOMETHING
YEAH
BUT IF WE USE A BATTERY STATION WHICH I THINK WE WILL USE
NO I DUNNO
YEAH I UH
YEAH THAT'S A GOOD IDEA OKAY
YEAH
WE'LL HAVE ENOUGH POWER TO
EVERYTHING AGRE EVERYONE AGREES WITH THAT OR OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
YEP
MAYBE WHAT PAUL SAID UH UNDER THE ON THE ON THE HOME STATION UH A BUTTON TO UH TO CALL YOUR UH REMOTE CONTROL THAT IT BEEPS
YEAH AND THEN YOU
OKAY YEAH
AND ALSO IT'S
BUT YOU HAVE TO MAKE A SOUND DEVICE IN IT THEN
YEAH THERE MUST BE SOUND IN IT
HMM
BUT YEAH
OKAY IT SHOULDN'T TAKE MUCH
I DUNNO
B MAYBE IT'S THAT THAT'S A LITTLE TOO HARD TO MAKE
YEAH
PRODUCTION COST IS UH T UH TWELVE AND A HALF
ESPECIALLY FOR THAT KIND OF MONEY
BECAUSE IT'S I IT HAS TO BE YEAH
BEC
MM UH TWENTY FIVE EUROS I THINK WE CAN MAKE IT
UH I TH
BUT BUT WE ONLY HAVE TO MAKE IT FOR TELEVISION AND UM WE MUST HAVE SOMETHING SPECIAL
TWELVE AND A HALF OKAY
SO
YEAH OKAY
BUT WE LOSE ABOUT NINETY PERCENT OF THOSE OPTIONS
SO I THINK YOU CAN UH
I THINK UH YOU ALSO HAVE UH REMOTE CONTROLS WITH A LOT OF OPTIONS
UH
WE HAVE TO GIVE OUR CUSTOMERS SOME EXTRAS
I THINK WE WILL SAVE MONEY WITH THAT
YEAH
YEAH OKAY
ARE YOU ALMOST FINISHED OR JUST
OKAY
YEAH THE THE PERSONAL PREFERENCE I DIDN'T FILL IT OUT
BECAUSE I WAS SHORT ON TIME
BUT UM
NO WORRY
OKAY
OKAY
BASICALLY WHAT WE COULD DO TOO IS UH HAVE A BLUETOOTH UH INTEGRATION
SO MAYBE YOU HAVE TO YEAH
YEAH I JUST WANT TO TALK SOME ABOUT SOME MORE
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH
WH WHAT'S THAT
SO THIS OH SORRY
WE HAVE TO HAVE A LOOK WHAT THEY ARE
WE HAVE SOME NEW UH PROJECT REQUIREMENTS
SO UH OH SORRY
THEY'RE STILL IN UM
I DON'T THINK SO BUT
UH TELETEXT HAS BECOME OUTDATED SINCE THE POPULARITY OF INTERNET
SO A TELETEXT OPTION MAYBE WE HAVE TO SKIP THAT ONE
I'M NOT SURE
NO AND I I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE USE UH TELETEXT STILL USE
NO
YEAH AND IT'S IT'S ON YOUR COMP IT'S ON YOUR TELEVISION
IT'S ONLY ONE BUTTON
UM
SO I DON'T THINK IT IS WE DEFINITELY SHOULD USE IT
UH
YEAH
HMM
YEAH THAT'S UH WHAT I TOLD YOU
THE REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD ONLY BE USED FOR A TELEVISION
SO THAT'S MAYBE EASIER
AND UM THE THE FORTY PLUS PEOPLE I ALREADY TOLD YOU
SO IT SHOULD BE FLASHY OR JUST MORE INTERESTING
OH THIS IS A PROBLEM
THE NEW PRODUCT SHOULD REACH A NEW MARKET WITH CUSTOMERS ARE THE YOUNGER THAN FORTY
I JUST I JUST DIDN'T READ IT WELL
OH SORRY ABOUT THAT
OH NO SORRY
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT
OKAY
OH
MM
OKAY THAT'S IT CHANGES THINGS
SO DOES IT MAKE SOME DECISION ABOUT THAT
CHANGES
THAT KINDA CHANGES THE WHOLE SITUATION
YEAH
UM
UH
I THINK UH THE THING IN THE DARK IS A GOOD WAY TO MAKE IT MORE LIKE A MOBILE PHONE
MORE MODERN
WELL YEAH THEN WE HAVE TO MAKE SOME NICE FEATURES
THAT STILL STAYS
YEAH
YEAH
THAT'S IMPORTANT I THINK AND
L. C. D. DOESN'T WORK FOR UH TWELVE AND A HALF EUROS I THINK
AND I D I DON'T DON'T THINK IT'S VERY USABLE IN A REMOTE CONTROL ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU ONLY HAVE T. V. FUNCTIONS ON IT
OH
YEAH
MM AH I I DON'T Y YOU'LL USE IT OFTEN BECAUSE YOU CAN SEE ON THE TELEVISION WH WHAT CHANNEL YOU
SO
NO IT'S NOT
OKAY
OH I'M WATCHING UH THE CHANNEL ONE
SO BUT UH YEAH
YEAH I THO I THINK THAT'S NOT USABLE
WHAT OTHER FEATURES CAN WE PUT IN
NO
I THINK YOU YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT A BIT FLASHY AND AND POPULAR
AND UH THEN THE USABILITY IS NOT THAT REQUIRED BECAUSE THE LIKE IN THE MOBILE PHONES USABILITY IS NOT THAT GOOD I THINK
YEAH
THAT'S VERY THAT'S FANCY
ABOUT YOU SAID ONE AND THE TELEVISION TURNS ON ONE
BUT UH SOME OF YOU HAD UH SOMETHING TO READ ABOUT UM UH SPEECH UH RECOGNITION
THAT'S COOL
TWELVE AND YOU'VE GOT TWELVE
IS THAT REACHABLE MAYBE
I DIDN'T READ
IT'S VERY FASHION
I DIDN'T READ ANY B YEAH
YEAH OKAY
MM
BUT ONLY THE NUMBERS ONE TO TWENTY OR SOMETHING
ONLY THE NUMBERS ONLY NUMBERS
THAT SHOULD BE COOL
UH FURTHERMORE NOTHING
I I KNOW
MM
YEAH MAYBE WE HAVE TO INTEGRATE THAT AS WELL
BUT
IF IT'S POSSIBLE
I DIDN'T READ IT
IF IT'S POSSIBLE I DUNNO
YEAH I DON'T KNOW
WHY SHOULD IT
YOU ONLY HAVE A MICROPHONE IN IT
I DON'T THINK IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE ACTUALLY
MM
UH IF I IF I I DIDN'T HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT THAT
YEAH I THINK IT'S
BUT IT HAS TO WORK
YEAH
AND AND AND DOES IT HAVE TO WORK ONLY IN ENGLISH OR IN DUTCH TOO OR
NAH MAYBE
AH THAT'S A PROBLEM BUT
AND AND UH W YEAH
UH ONLY IN ENGLISH
ONLY IN ENGLISH I THINK
UH DOES YOUR UH DOES IT LIE IN THE CENTRE OF THE ROOM AND CAN YOU SCREAM FROM WHEREVER
WHAT BUT UH I DUNNO HOW THAT WORKS THEN
YEAH IT'S PROBABLY MY JOB TO FIGURE THAT OUT BUT
NO THAT
UH ONE TO HAVE IN CHANNEL ONE
YEAH THEN TH WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THAT
BUT DO DO WE DO IT
IT'S MORE IF WE IF WE DO IT
YEAH I DUNNO
THAT'S WHAT I'M LOOKING AT
SO IS IT VERY USABLE
AND AND DO YOU HAVE TO SPEAK IN IN LIKE IN A THING OR
YEAH
IS
IT WE HAVE SHORT TIME TO TO PUT IT ON THE MARKET SO THAT
MAYBE MAYBE IT'S TOO HARD TO UH TO REALISE THAT
YEAH I DUNNO
OKAY
WE HAVE TO DO A LOT OF TESTING BEFORE WE CAN DO THAT
MM YEAH WELL
YEAH I THINK SO
WE MAKE UH MAKE UH WE CAN MAKE TH TH THE NEW REMOTE CONTROL VERY FLASHY
YEAH AND UH AND UH
IT'S
IN UH INDEED UH THE LANGUAGES ARE A DIFFICULT THING
UH BECAUSE WE WE HAVE A LOT OF LANGUAGES
I DON'T THINK IT'S UH USEFUL ENOUGH TO TAKE THE EFFORT TO DESIGN SOMETHING WITH UH SPEECH RECOGNITION
I D YEAH
YEAH
AND AND
YEAH AND ALSO IF IF YOU HAVE A GOOD SPEECH UH SPEECH RECOGNITION YOU CAN JUST THROW THE UH
YEAH
I THINK SO
YEAH
YEAH IT'S NOT UH
A UH SOMEONE SAYS THAT UH GIVE ME ONE COKE AND THE T. V. TURNS UH TO ONE
THE REMOTE AWAY
YEAH OKAY
HMM
MM
MM
YEAH
AND THEN YOU HAVE TO SAY UH T. V. CHANNEL ONE OR SOMETHING
NOT JUST ONE BUT
WELL YEAH THAT'S THE RIGHT COMMAND
BUT
HMM YEAH
T. V. ONE
OKAY BUT TH THAT BECOMES YOUR F UH UH BECAUSE THAT'S VERY HARD FOR UH SPEECH RECOGNITION
WELL I DUNNO
BUT I DON'T THINK IT JUST AIN'T USEFUL ENOUGH
YEAH
MM-HMM
DO WE DO WE MAKE UH A LIGHT UNDER THE UNDER THE N UNDER THE NUMBERS AND EVERYTHING
DO IF YOU PRESS SOMETHING IT LIGHTS UP FOR A FEW SECONDS SO YOU CAN SEE WHAT OTHER BUT BUTTONS THERE ARE OKAY
SO WE HAVE TO MAKE SOME DECISIONS
SO YOU CAN SEE ON THE UH SO WE HAVE TO KNOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO PUT ON
OKAY NO SPEECH RECOGNITION
YEAH I THINK SO
YEAH THAT'S GOOD
YEP
OKAY WE JUST TAKE THAT ONE
AND WHAT ELSE WE HAVE
SO UH
ALSO THE ONE IN THE DARK
IT LIGHTS UP WHEN IT'S DARK
I DIDN'T
YEAH BUT IT'S OH TH I THOUGHT WOULD THAT THAT WOULD BE THE SAME
IF YOU PUSH SOMETHING IT IT ALL LIGHTS UP
OKAY
YEAH
IT UH UH IT HAVE TO WORK ONLY WHEN YOU USE IT
YEAH YEAH IT IT MUSTN'T WORK ALL THE TIME
SO IF YOU NO IF YOU USE ONE BUTTON IT MUST TURN UH ON FOR TWENTY SECONDS AND THEN IT MUST TURN OFF
YEAH BUT UM
YES THAT'S WHAT I MEAN
OR YOU CAN SWITCH IT ON OR SOMETHING
OR MAYBE WHEN YOU YEAH
IT LIGHTS UP ALL
THAT'S WHAT I SAID
YOU HAVE TO YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
IT'S THE SAME AS THE TELEPHONE
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
YEAH
D YEAH ALRIGHT
OKAY YEAH
YEAH
OR JUST A NORMAL REMOTE CONTROL
AND DO WE USE A A UH WHAT'S IT CALLED
LIKE A IMAC IF YOU CAN LOOK THROUGH IT
MAYBE JUST AS AN OPTION W LIKE WE DISCUSSED LIKE IPOD
DIFFERENT COLOURS UH MAYBE USE EVEN DIFFERENT FONTS
MM MAYBE IT'S A GOOD IDEA
YEAH
OH YEAH
LIKE UH PHONES
DIFFERENT COLOURS
OKAY SO Y YOU JUST MAKE IT TH THROUGH YOU LOOK THROUGH IT
OKAY
HMM
MM THAT'S COOL
A SEE THROUGH
UH AS AN OPTION MAYBE
YEAH
WE PUT IN THE THE SIMPLE BUTTONS ON THE TOP AND PROBABLY THE THE THE MORE COMPLICATED BUTTONS DOWN THERE
AND SO THE BUTTONS WE HAVE THIS IS YEAH THIS IS NORMAL
IT'S THE STANDARD
YEAH UH
BUT YOU HAVE YOU HAD A LOT OF DIFFERENT BUTTONS
YEAH WE BUT WE DON'T WE DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY COMPLICATED BUTTONS
HMM
YEAH MAYBE YOU HAVE YOU HAVE TO UH WHEN YOU USE TELETEC TELETEXT
YOU CAN PRESS A GREEN OR A RED BUTTON TO GO TO THE NEXT ONE OR TO GO TO THE PREVIOUS ONE
YEAH OKAY BUT
YEAH WELL W I THINK THE BUTTONS ARE VERY EASY
WITH JUST UH STANDARD BUTTONS WE JUST HAVE SO LITTLE
O BUT MAYBE YOU CAN PUT UM THE G THE OPTIONS OF TELETEXT ON THE SECOND LEVEL OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
BECAUSE YOU NE ALMOST NEVER USE IT
NO I DON'T NEED DON'T NEED UH TELETEXT OPTIONS ARE ONLY FOUR BUTTONS OR SOMETHING
SO UH
YEAH BUT YOUNGER PEOPLE I THINK UM MORE OFTEN USE THE INTERNET AND ELDERLY PEOPLE OFTEN USE TELETEXT
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
I USE TELETEXT AS WELL
NO I USE TE TELETEXT EVERY DAY I THINK
OKAY
HMM
SO WE JUST KEEP IT ONE LEVEL THEN
FOR ME TOO IT IS
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH YEAH ONE LEVEL
AND I THINK UH 'CAUSE UM WE DON'T HAVE THAT MANY BUTTONS I THINK THE DESIGN IS MOST IMPORTANT
YOU CAN D UH INTEGRATE THE BUTTONS IN THE DESIGN VERY MUCH
MM
YEAH
YEAH
'CAUSE SIMPLE BUTTONS
IF YOU PUT ONE ABOVE IT IT'S CLEAR
OKAY
OKAY
SO THAT'S IT FOR TODA FOR WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A LUNCH LUNCH BREAK
UM
HOW LONG IS LUNCH BREAK
SO YEAH YOU KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO
THIS IS UH THIS IS IT
YOU GET YOUR MEAL AND EVERYTHING SO
OKAY
TRENDWATCHING
THAT'S FINE
YEAH
YO
SO WE'RE FINISHED FOR T FOR THIS TIME
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME LUNCH
OKAY
BYE
YEAH
YEAH
MM
UH
BONJOUR
IT'S IT WON'T WAKE UP
YEAH
LIKE
I WAS A BIT EARLY
WHY
UH NORMALLY I WAS ONE OF THEM
NO I JUST CAME IN
WHAT
OKAY
COME ON
CHECK CHECK CHECK CHECK
HELLO
OOP
WHY WON'T IT WAKE UP
IS IT ON
YOU TURNED IT OFF
THE POWER LIGHT DOESN'T WORK
BUT HOW
AH THERE IT IS
OKAY
OKAY
UH
I RECEIVED AN EMAIL WITH UH A FEW POSSIBILITIES ON UH THE MATERIALS
YEAH
SO I'LL DISCUSS THEM WITH YOU
OKAY WE'RE JUST GOING TO THE LATER
OKAY
YEAH I RECEIVED AN EMAIL AS WELL
SO WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE CONCEPTUAL MODEL
OH
HMM
WHICH ONE WAS MINE
SO THAT'S ME
SO UH OKAY
UH OKAY
WHATEVER
OKAY SO I JUST SHOW YOU THE M THE NO MM MM THE THE THE THE THE THE MINUTES MINUTE
WHAT'S IT CALLED I DUNNO
THE MINUTES
OKAY SO WE JUST TALKED ABOUT UH OH YOU WANT ME TO SHOW THAT THERE OR
UH
NO JUST TELL US
MM NO
UM
HAS TO LOOK NICE
USABILITY IS VERY IMPORTANT
OKAY WE JUST TALKED ABOUT IT LOOKS
PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO SPEND MONEY ON SOMETHING THAT'S SIMILAR TO CHEAPER ONES
IT HAS TO BE VERY BASIC NOT TOO MANY BUTTONS
LIGHT SWITCHES ON IF YOU USE A BUTTON
UH TEXT T. V. STILL HAS TO BE A POSSIBILITY
AND IT HAS TO BE EASY TO LEARN
THAT ARE THE FUNCTIONS
THAT RIGHT
THAT WERE THE THINGS I UH MAKE MINUTES OF
AND THE FUNCTIONS ARE VOLUME CHANNEL TO CHOOSE CHANNELS AN ON OFF A MUTE UH BUTTON AND A TEXT T. V. BUTTON
YEAH
YES
SO I JUST WANT TO GIVE YOU UH MIKE AGAIN THE FIRST UH
OKAY
PRESENTATION OF YOUR
SHALL I START
YEAH
NO
OKAY WELL
I RECEIVED AN EMAIL
OKAY
IT HAS BEEN DONE IN ITALY UH ITALY AND IN
I SEARCHED THE WEB UH AND UH I SEARCHED UH ON THIS D DOCUMENT RECENT INVESTIGATION OF THE REMOTE CONTROL MARKET
SO WHAT MICHAEL JUST SAID IT MUST BE UH SOME VERY DIFFERENT FROM ORDINARY UH REMOTE CONTROLS
UH ANOTHER COUNTRY IN EUROPE I FORGET IT
UH BUT UH THEY FOUND OUT THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT FOR REMOTE CONTROLS HAPPENS TO BE A FANCY LOOK AND FEEL INSTEAD OF THE CURRENT FUNCTIONAL LOOK AND FEEL
SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO CREATE SOMETHING NEW
FANCY STANDS FOR AN ORIGINAL LOOK AND FEEL OF THE CASE AND INTERFACE
UH THIS UH ASPECT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE
THE SECOND UH MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT IS THAT A REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD IT UH TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIVE
IT UH IS TWICE IMPORTANT AS THE FOLLOWING
UH IT CAME OUT OF THE RESEARCH
AND THEN UH THAT UH THIS IS A POINT OF DISCUSSION BECAUSE WE JUST DECIDED THAT WE DON'T MAKE USE OF UH L. C. D. OR UH SPEECH RECOGNITION
UH THAT STANDS FOR UH UH NEW TECHNICAL UH FEATURES
HMM
BUT UM THIS IS THE SECOND UH IMPORTANT UH ASPECT AND I THINK UH WE MUST USE SOME OF THE NEW TECHNOLOGY TO BE UH INNOVATIVE
BUT WE ALREADY HAVE THE FLASHING FLASHING LIGHT ON THE
UH MAYBE MAYBE SOMETHING NEW
AND THAT'S VERY HARD I THINK
WE HAVE TO DISCUSS ABOUT IT S UH OKAY UH FEATURES NOT UH DO NOT EXIST IN CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS
YEAH MORE
HMM
WELL I'LL I'LL GET BACK ON IT
OKAY
UH D OUR OUR TARGET GROUP UH WE THOUGHT ABOUT WAS YOUNG AND TRENDY
UH THE THIRD ONE IS THE ASPECT OF THE REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD BE EASY TO USE
WE ALREADY DISCUSSED THAT
BUT UH THAT WAS AN OVERALL UH POINT
UM I'VE GOT ONE PICTURE
YEAH
AND IT SAYS UH FASHION WATCHERS OF UH UH PARI UH FRANCE AND UH ITALY YEAH UH HAVE DETECTED THE FOLLOWING TRENDS
SO I TOOK UH THAT PART OF THE WEBPAGE
THIS TRENDS I TH UH TREND I THINK IT'S NOT UM THAT MEANINGFUL FOR US MAYBE
BUT THE UH THE NEXT UH ASPECT ALSO IN CONTRAST TO LAST YEAR THE FEEL OF MATERIAL IS EXPE UH UH IS EXPECTED TO BE SPONGY
SPONGY
BUT IT'S ABOUT UH CLOTHES AND SHOES
BUT SPONGY WHAT WHAT DOES SPONGY SAYS
HMM
SPONGY
SPONGY
SPONGY LIKE SPONGE
OKAY
SO RUBBER KIND OF
UH SOFT MATERIALS
YEAH
BUT MAYBE TH THAT'S AL DEFINITELY A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE YOU'VE YOU'RE YOU DROP Y YOUR REMOTE CONTROL VERY OFTEN ON THE GROUND
SO IT HAS TO BE FLEXIBLE
YEAH BUT YEAH
YEAH IT'S SOMETHING THAT UH IT STAND THERE
BUT I DIDN'T KNEW UH KNEW WHAT IT MEANS
SO SPONGY MEANS Y YEAH
YEAH
IT'S LIKE A SPONGE
SOFT SPONGE
SO IT'S ALSO A STRESS BALL
THAT'S A GOOD THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
IF IT'S DE LIKE THAT
THAT'S GOOD A GOOD IDEA
IS IT A BIT LIKE LIKE THE THE THE THE REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH SOMEWHAT LIKE
YEAH BUT YEAH
HOW ARE YOU GONNA MAKE IT
R. SOFT
UH
YEAH I'VE SOME UH MATERIAL UH INFORMATION BUT I'LL GIVE YOU IT LATER IN MY PRESENTATION
OKAY
OKAY
WHAT DO I THINK
UH BECAUSE A FANCY LOOK IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING UH FOR REMOTE CONTROL UH CONTROL I THINK ABOUT CHANGEABLE FRONTS
YEAH
BECAUSE IT'S UH IT'S HOT
UH MAYBE A SEE THROUGH ONE IN A A FRUIT FRONT
AND UH SOME BASIC UH COLOUR FRONTS
WE HAVE TO DISCUSS ABOUT THAT
JUST UH SOMETHING ROUND IN IT OR UH MAYBE NOT UH NOT UH YEAH I DUN DUNNO
UH SO WE CAN MAKE UH FIVE DIFFERENT FRONTS TO START WITH OR SOMETHING
UH MAYBE AN EXTRAORDINARY SHAPE LIKE A SPONGE
UH OR UH YEAH JUST ANOTHER SHAPE THAN A NORMAL UH REMOTE CONTROL HA UH HAS
YEAH
WE MA MUST HAVE SOME KIND OF GADGET
YEAH HOW DO WE DO THAT
MAIN POINT UH STILL UH IS THE TECHNOLO TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIVE
UH Y YEAH
MAYBE SPEECH
YEAH I'LL GET BACK ON THAT
SO
HMM
BECAUSE IT'S ONLY TWELVE AND A HALF EUROS YOU HAVE TO SPEND ON EVERY REMOTE CONTROL
IT'S VERY UH DIFFICULT TO TO TO DO IT
INTRO YEAH
YEAH THAT'S THE PROBLEM
THAT'S THE MAIN PROBLEM
WELL I GOT F ALSO AN EMAIL FROM
SO
THE THE TECHNOLOGY DEPARTMENT
MAYBE WE WATCH THE FIRST UH THE NEXT TWO PRESENTATIONS
SO THEY RECOMMENDED USING IT
THEY HAVE DONE UH RESEARCH ABOUT IT AND UH EVEN MORE POSSIBILITIES NOW WITH SPEECH
WELL
OKAY
HMM
UH LET'S FIRST WATCH PAUL'S PRESENTATION FIRST THEN
OKAY
I'LL CHECK WHAT THEY EXACT MEAN
SO UH
BUT MAYBE IT'S CHEAP AND IT'S EASY TO IMPLEMENT
YEAH WELL ACTUALLY WE HAVE DON'T HAVE AN IDEA HOW MUCH IT'S GONNA COST
I THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER TO IMPLEMENT L. C. D. AS WELL
YEAH TH THAT'S THE ONLY PROBLEM
I D THEY DON'T SAY HOW MUCH IT WILL COST SO UM BUT UH IF WE IMPLEMENT UH SPEECH RECOGNITION
IT'S MASS PRODUCTION
OH
SO YOU CAN SAY YOU CAN
SINCE YOU HAVE TO UH CONFIGURE SPEECH THING
BUT THAT'S DEFINITELY MORE EXPENSIVE THAN
YEAH THAT'S THAT'S SOMETHING I DUNNO
BUT HOW UH WE WE'RE GONNA MAKE MANY OF THOSE
SO WE CAN START A MASS PRODUCTION AND THEN THE COST WILL STILL WILL BE
YEAH
SO UH
BUT A TELEPHONE ALSO HAVE A L. C. D. AND AND IT'S ABOUT T TWO HUNDRED EUROS
YEAH BUT A TELEPHONE OKAY YEAH
YEAH SO UH WE GOTTA DE
WE HAVE TO DECIDE ON THAT
YEAH
OKAY
THAT WAS THIS
MM UH
OH I GOT AN EMAIL UH
AND IT SAYS UH THE CHIP CAN BE UH SIMPLE REGULAR OR ADVANCED
AND
UM
THEY SAY UH A DISPLAY REQUIRES AN ADVANCED CHIP
SO IT'S M THE MOST EXPENSIVE
AND THIS IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN ALL THE OTHER CHIPS
L. D. C. DOESN'T REQUIRE
THE DISPLAY REQUIRES AN ADVANCED CHIP
YEAH IT SAYS IN THE EMAIL
OKAY
AND SPEECH RECOGNITION
YEAH PROBABLY TOO
I I HAVEN'T GOT ANYTHING ABOUT SPEECH RECOGNITION BUT
ADVANCED
YEAH
I'LL I'LL GIVE YOU MY DESIGN
WELL IT D THAT'S THAT'S THE MOST EXPENSIVE CHIP WE NEED
IF WE'RE DOING UH IF WE'RE DOING A DISPLAY
SO WE WELL WE CAN
YEAH OKAY
I HAD UH
I WATCHED THE OLD REMOTE CONTROLS AND NEWS COM REMOTE COMO UH REMOTE CONTROLS
TO MAKE A SORT OF A DESIGN
SO I DID SOME SEARCHING ON THE INTERNET
Y YES
MOBILE PHONES
I THINK WE SHOULD UM THIS IS ONE OF THE MODERN REMOTE CONTROLS OF THE MOMENT
I THINK WE SHOULD GO MORE TO THE IPOD AND M. P. THREE PLAYERS
MORE MODERN
YEAH JUST MODERN MODERN BUT STILL UH BASIC
UM YOU PROBABLY HAVE TO MAKE IT A BIT BIGGER AND A BIT SMALLER
'CAUSE REMOTE CON CONTROL YOU CAN SEE IT HERE YOU HAVE TO BO REACH BOTH OUT BOTH SIDES
SO THAT'S THAT'S THE MAIN DIFFERENCE
BUT LOOKS UH I DEFINITELY THINK WE SHOULD GO LIKE THIS
AND HERE YOU JUST HAVE ONE FEW BUTTONS
AND THEN CHANGEABLE FONTS SO
HMM
IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT PART I THINK
BUT AND THE HOME BASE IS SOMETHING LIKE THAT SOMETHING SIMPLE
AND TH MAYBE TWO OTHERS I DUNNO
WELL AND THEN I JUST ORDERED THE THE BUTTONS A BIT
UH BASIC BUTTONS
ON OFF MUTE
TEXT BUTTONS
YEAH MAYBE THE TELETEXT TEL
YEAH TEXT BUTTON MAYBE THERE AND THERE
I DON'T FIND IT VERY USABLE BUT IT'S UH I DON'T THINK IT'S FITS IN THE THE MODERN THEME AS WELL
AND THEN THE COLOUR BUTTONS IF WE WANT IT ON
NO I DON'T UH I DON'T LIKE IT
NO
HMM
SO AND THEN YEAH WE SAW THE THE PLA DISPLAY IN THE THE IPOD
THEY CAN PUT THE BASIC BUTTONS ONE TWO THREE FOUR
AND I THINK
AND UH F ABOVE TEN
BUT IT THAT'S ON ON THE DISPLAY
THAT TH THERE IS NO DISPLAY THERE
NO NO
BUT IT'S ON THE PLACE OF THE DISPLAY
AND I THINK WE SHOULD UH LIGHT THIS UP
MUCH MORE THAN THAT PART
SO THE FOCUS IS ON THESE TWO PARTS
YEAH
YEAH
SO YOU DON'T SEE ALL THE BUTTONS YOU ELSE NEED
BECAUSE UM THE VOLUME AND CHANNEL IS ON THE ON THE THE BOTTOM OF IT
BUT IT SOUNDS VERY DIFFICULT TO USE
SO YOU CAN'T USE YOUR THUMB FOR IT
UH WELL UM
UM
THIS IS HOW IT IS NOW
HERE UH WELL WE HAVE VOLUME
I THINK IT IS ON UH ON THE BOTTOM TOO
YEAH DOWN THERE
BUT IT'S NOT NOT THE BEST BEST
YEAH
WELL HERE WE HAVE ALSO SIDE SCROLLS
DO WE WANT TO USE
I DUNNO IF WE CAN USE THAT
YEAH I'VE I'VE GOT SOMETHING OF THAT UH TOO
YEAH OKAY
FOR VOLUME OR A CHANNEL
YEAH FOR VOLUME
YEAH WHY NOT
WELL THEN WE CAN EVEN SIMPLIFY IT MORE
FOR VOLUME
SCROLL
AND AND JUST CHANNEL BUTTONS HERE
BY JUST PUTTING THE VOLUME ON THE SIDE
AND THE CHANNELS AS WELL
OH YEAH
AND YOU CAN'T USE THEM NOW WITH YOUR THUMB BECAUSE THE THING IS NOT IT'S NOT EASY TO CONTROL
YEAH OR UH MAYBE UH THE CHANNEL BUTTONS ARE OFTEN USED
BUT I THINK UH
YEAH WELL IT'S
WELL
BASICALLY IT'S IT'S HERE
YEAH OKAY M MAYBE WE CHO SHOULD PUT THAT ON TOP AND BUTTONS WE WE DON'T USE ON IN THE BOTTOM
YEAH THAT'S BETTER
THEY'RE ON TOP
YEAH JUST TH TH TH OTHER BUTTONS LIKE TEXT T. V.
PUT THAT ON THE BUTTON BOTTOM
BECAUSE UH YOU CAN'T HOLD IT
YOU CAN'T HOLD IT TH THE CONTROL AND PUSH THE BUTTONS
YOU MEAN UH THESE TO THE LOW
MM-HMM
YEAH
EXCEPT FROM THE ON OFF BUTTON
OH OKAY
WELL YEAH
BUT I I THINK W YOU'LL USE UH THE SWITCH CHANNELS BUTTONS UH MORE OFTEN THAN THE NORMAL UH CHANNEL BUTTONS LIKE ONE TWO THREE
SO MAYBE WE CAN PUT THAT ON THE BOTTOM
MM
I DUNNO BUT YEAH WE'LL
MAYBE
LIKE ZAPPING IS JUST SWITCHING ONE CHANNEL AT A TIME
YEAH MAYBE IT'S NOT EASY IF IT'S BELOW
IT'S HARDER TO ZAP
SO I THINK UH IT SHOULD BE
SHOULD BE EASY TO
I THINK IT'S PRETTY STANDARD THESE RUBBER BUTTONS ON THE TOP
YEAH OKAY
THAT'S THAT'S GOOD BUT
I THINK IT'S MODERN TO LIGHT THIS AREA UP AND TO LIGHT THIS AREA UP
AND UH IF YOU DON'T LIGHT 'EM UP THEY DON'T UH YOU DON'T SEE 'EM VERY GOOD
SO THE FOCUS GETS ON THESE PARTS AND NOT ON THERE
YEAH OKAY
BUT UH THE POSITION OF COURSE CAN BE DIFFERENT
IT'S S WE HAVE TO LOOK UH WHAT'S EASY TO USE AND HOW IT'S EASIER TO USE
YEAH
SO WE CAN UH SWITCH THESE TO I DUNNO IF IT L WILL LOOK GOOD IF YOU PUT THOSE ON T ON THE BOTTOM HALF
HMM
BUT UH WE WE CAN SWITCH THOSE TWO YEAH
THEY SH THOSE SHOULD BE ON TOP
NO I THINK TH THE THE TOP BUTTONS ARE OKAY
YEAH MAYBE THOSE TWO YEAH
AND UH YEAH YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE IT'S EASY TO UH YES IT HAS TO BE BIG ENOUGH SO YOU CAN HOLD IT RIGHT
OKAY
OKAY
I THINK THAT IF WE'RE GONNA PUT IN MORE TECHNOLOGY THAT YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO UH SWITCH IT OPEN
WELL THAT'S THAT'S MY FINDINGS
AND UH WELL UM IF WE WANT TO PUT IN SPEECH REC RECOGNITION OR SOMETHING WE I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD PUT IT ON TOP THEN
M. P. THREE PLAYER
SO UH MY PERSONAL OPINION IS THAT WE SHOULD GO MORE MODERN LOOK
YEAH
TO USE
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S COOL
SO IF YOU PUT IN UH SPEECH RECOGNITION YOU NEED SO MORE UH MANY MORE BUTTONS
WHICH WON'T LOOK GOOD ON THE FRONT SIDE I THINK
OKAY
NO
SO THAT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE TO DECIDE ON
YEAH WE HAVE TO KEEP IT SIMPLE
YEAH
WE HAVE TO DECIDE THIS THIS LECTURE OR THIS THIS THIS UH FIFTY MINUTES YEAH HOW IT IS GONNA LOOK
OKAY
WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO
OKAY THE COMPONENT DESIGN
I LOOKED AT UH SOME SIMILAR DEVICES AND UH MY OWN COMMON KNOWLEDGE
IF YOU AIM AT A YOUNG PUBLIC YOU SHOULD USE MATERIALS THAT ARE SOFT WITH PRIMARY COLOURS LIKE GREEN BLUE RED
SO
SO UH THIS WAS ON THE WEB SITE
UH SHAPES SHOULD BE CURVED SO ROUND SHAPES
NOT NOTHING SQUARE LIKE
FLASHY KINDA COLOURS
OKAY SO HMM OKAY
YEAH WELL UH IPOD IS TRENDY
AND IT IS WELL CURVED SQUARE
YEAH
LIKE
SQUARE
SO WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TOO SQUARE CORNERS AND THAT KIND OF THING
YEAH BUT MM IS UH HAS ROUND CORNERS I THINK
SO NOT
OKAY
YEAH OKAY
NOT UH THE OLD UH BOX LOOK
YEAH
AND UM SPORTS AND GAMING DEVICE STYLE CHARACTERISTICS
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THAT MEANS BUT IT SHOULD BE WELL YEAH POPULAR KIND OF
MM
LOOKING I THINK
SO THE COLOURS ALSO
YEAH WE HAVE TO PUT OUR REAL REACTION LOGO AS WELL ON THE ON THE REMOTE CONTROL
SO WE HAVE HA TO MA MAKE IT IN BLACK BLACK YELLOW
OKAY
MM YEAH IT'S
YEAH
BLACK YELLOW CONTROL
MAYBE THE SIDES IN YELLOW AND THE THE THE TOP IN BLACK
YEAH MM N
NOT THAT WEIRD BECAUSE WE DEFINITELY WANT TO MAKE IT KIND OF FLASHY TO ATTRACT A YOUNG PUBLIC
YEAH BUT UH I DON'T THINK THE THE COLOURS BLACK AND YELLOW GO WELL TOGETHER
BUT
NO OKAY
THAT'S A THAT'S A SEN
WE MAKE I MAYBE YOU CAN PUT YELLOW ON THE SIDE AND BLACK ON THE ON THE FRONT
THAT'S JUST A MATTER OF TASTES BUT
YEAH OKAY
WE HAVE TO USE UH KIND OF FLASHY COLOURS I THINK
CAN WE DO THAT
SO
UH CAN'T WE USE UM DIFFERENT UH FRON UH FRONTS WITH ALL WITH THE THE LOGO ON IT
YEAH
YEAH IT'S COOL
YEP
AND STILL TRANS
LIKE FRONTS IN IN RED AND YELLOW AND BLUE AND
YES
SO
OH YEAH
STILL STILL TRANSPARENT
OKAY
BUT WITH ALL WITH LOGO ON IT
YEAH
OKAY
WELL THIS IS A REMOTE CONTROL A VERY OLD ONE
THE CASE HAS JUST A HERE'S BLACK
UM THEN THE COMPONENTS
BUT WE ARE MAKING IT UH
UH I'M NOT SURE
YEAH WE MAKE IT SOM MAYBE WE HAVE TO MAKE IT FROM SOFT MATERIAL
YEAH I DUNNO
YEAH
MAYBE
WE DECIDED THAT HUH
BUT ANYWAYS UH IT SHOULD BE TRANSPARENT
S
YOU CAN JUST LIKE A MOBILE PHONE YOU CAN MAKE UM DIFFERENT FRONTS ON IT
SO YOU CAN JUST REPLACE THEM I THINK
WELL ONE OF THE OPTIONS
OKAY
YEAH WE COULD DO THAT
THAT WAS THE IDEA OR JUST UH RELEASE ONE
YEAH
JUST GIVE FIVE WITH THEM JUST IN A BOX
FIVE DIFFERENT
YEAH UH OR JUST UH SELL DIFFERENT ONES
SO YOU CAN STILL TH LOOK THROUGH IT
YEAH BUT Y YOU COULD YOU COULD MAKE 'EM UH UH LIKE BLUE AND TRANSPARENT
YEAH
COOL
YEAH
YEAH
SOFT
UM THE BUTTONS
LIKE NORMAL ORDINARY BUTTONS
NORMAL RUBBER I THINK
YEAH I UH I DUNNO
A MORE
IT IT COULD BE LIKE A NOKIA LIKE PLASTIC
YEAH
THAT'S BETTER PROB YEAH
UH UH
YEAH JUST UH
WITH THE HARD HARD BUTTONS
I THINK UH RUBBER REALLY HAS AN ODD LOOK
OKAY
YEAH
THE THE THE NEW UH NEW MODERN UH REMOTE CONTROLS
UH THE BUTTONS ARE PART OF THE UH THE STYLE I THINK IS PART OF THE REMOTE CONTROL ITSELF
YEAH
YEAH
UH IT'S N DOESN'T IS UH A BUTTON UH UM HOW DO YOU SAY IT
IT IT DIDN'T IT I IT DON'T COME OUT OF THE ON THE BACKGROUND
IT IT'S ONE UH A ONE UH OUT OF ONE SHAPE
IT IS IN UH THE C A REMOTE CONTROL UH
YEAH IT'S IT'S ALL ON ONE LEVEL
YEAH ON ONE LEVEL
YEAH
YEAH I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN
SO WE HAVE TO KEEP IT ON THE ONE LEVEL
LIKE TH THE TOP IT'S YEAH
YEAH
LIKE UH THE IPOD
UH JUST
YEAH LIKE MOBILE PHONES
YEAH OKAY
THEN THE BUTTONS
OKAY IT'S CHOS SO THAT SHOULD BE HARD PLASTIC
YEAH THAT'S COOL
I THINK
OR MAYBE
BUT
I DUNNO WHAT UH KIND OF MATERIAL IT IS
JUST ONLY THE BASIC UH
BUT MAYBE YOU CAN M MAKE A UH ROUND FLUFF OR SOFT MATERIAL
YEAH
OOPS
BASIC REMOTE CONTROL FROM NORMAL PLASTIC AND
YEAH
THE ROUNDS OF IT FROM SOFTER S
OKAY
YEAH
THE NORMAL INFRARED L. E. D. I THINK S SUFFICIENT
AND BACK LIGHT L. E. D. S
SO IF YOU PUT
SO BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO MAKE THE CASE TRANSPARENT OTHERWISE THE BACK LIGHT WON'T WORK
AND UM THEN THE L. E. D.
I DUNNO
Y
YEAH
COOL
YEAH
Y I IF YOU THE NUMBERS COULD BE CAN BE YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
UH YOU CAN JUST MAKE THEM AROUND THE BUTTONS UH YEAH
OKAY
OR IT RUNS THE WHOLE
SO OR NO
YEAH BUT WE CAN STILL MAKE IT TRANSPARENT
THEY CAN CHOOSE
YEAH YOU CAN HALFS TRANSPARENT OR JUST THAT IT'S COMES OUT A BIT
YEAH OKAY
GOOD
AND IN GREEN COLOUR THE BACK LIGHTS OR
DIFFERENT I THINK ALSO
YEAH
BLUE
WHATEVER YOU WANT IT I THINK
BLUE OR RED
UH DEPENDS ON THE COLOUR OF THE
YEAH
YEAH BUT YOU CAN'T CHOO YOU CAN'T CHOOSE IT WHEN YOU BUY IT
YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE
UH I
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
BUT
SO
NO BUT I THINK THERE ARE MULTIPLE COLOUR LEDS
IS IT OKAY
YEAH BUT CAN YOU CHANGE IT IF YOU ALREADY BOUGHT THE THE REMOTE CONTROL
YOU
I I KNOW I DUNNO
IS
YEAH IT CAN
'CAUSE THIS A MO MIB UH MOBILE PHONE AS WELL
YEAH OKAY
MAYBE IT'S IT'S MORE IMPOR MORE EXPENSIVE
I THINK IT'S
MAYBE PUT SOME DIFFERENT ONES IN IT
DOESN'T MATTER
IT'S JUST NO JUST SOME LED
AND I CAN CHANGE THE COLOUR OF IT
I HAVE THE MO MI I HAVE A BLINKING LIGHT ON MY PHONE
JUST MAKE IT SOME DIFFERENT COLOURS
OKAY COOL
BLUE RED AND GREEN OR SOMETHING
YEAH I DUNNO
MAYBE IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE BUT IT I TH I DON'T THINK SO
WELL WE DON'T PUT PUT IN ANY FANCIER TECHNOLOGY YET
SO
HMM
THEN UH SOME MORE TECHNICAL THINGS
W SO WE D WE JUST NEED THIS AND THIS TRANSISTORS AND RESONATORS
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS BUT IT SHOULD BE THERE I THINK
UM THIS IS THE NORMAL CIRCUIT BOARD LIKE A CHIP BOARD IN IN A LOT OF UH THINGS
THERE'S ALL THESE KIND OF THINGS
YEAH WE HAVE TO HURRY UP A BIT SO
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY DO OR
UM THEY THEY BASICALLY SAID THAT THAT'S ALMOST THE SAME ON ANY UH REMOTE CONTROLS
SO I GUESS WE J WE JUST NEED THAT
I'M SURE WE CAN FIT IN
YEAH
OKAY YEAH YOU CAN YOU CAN CHANGE YEAH
NO
WE JUST
YEAH OKAY
UH THE BATTERY CONTACTS LIKE NORMAL BATTERIES CA YOU CAN PUT IN
NAH BUT THEY JUST SAID WE NEED IT
OKAY
YEAH A RECHARGER MAYBE
YEAH WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE TO UH
YEAH BUT
YEAH OKAY
IS THAT STILL THE
WE STILL WANT TO HAVE A RECHARGER DON'T WE
YES
YES
YEAH BUT IT I WE DON'T WANNA HAVE A AR AN HOW DO YOU CALL IT
ACCU
A RECHA OH NO
YEAH
IT'S JUST A BATTERY
UH BATTERY
RE RECHARGER
BASE STATION
Y UH JUST JUST BATTERIES RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES
YES RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES I THINK'S BEST
YEAH BATTERIES
AND UH A CHIP THAT'S THIS ONE
OKAY
NOT A SEPARATE OKAY
NO JUST RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES
UM FOR THE ENERGY SOURCE WE CAN USE BATTERIES OR A KINETIC UH LIKE WITH THE PULSE WATCH
SO IT OPERATES ON YOUR WRIST KINDA
THEN UH I RECEIVED SOME POSSIBILITIES
AH COOL
OKAY
SO IF YOU HOLD IT IT GETS POWERED
IF YOU HOLD IT
BUT NORMALLY YOU PUT A REMOTE CONTROL ON THE TABLE OR ON THE COUCH
BUT YOU MOSTLY USE IT INDOORS SO
YEAH I DON'T THINK IT WILL WORK AND OR WE CAN ALSO USE SOLAR CELLS
IT'S JUST BATTERIES THAT'S CHEAPER
NO
IT'S DARK IN THE ROOM
AND THREE D. CURVED IS ALSO IN DEPTH
UM CASES FLAT SO UNCURVED
UH TWO D. CURVED IS UM LIKE FRONT TO THE BACK
YEAH AND AND WE CAN USE THE HOME STATION KIND OF THING
YEAH
OKAY
UH BUT WITH THREE D. UH CURVED UH REMOTE CONTROLS WE MUST USE RUBBER BUTTONS
SO WE CAN'T USE THE FLAT BUTTONS
SO THAT'S POSSIBLE
MM
SO WE NEED UH TWO D.
YEAH I THINK
YEAH
DEFINITELY
UM THESE KINDA MATERIALS CAN BE USED
BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WE JUST MAKE IT PLASTIC
YEAH
YEAH I THINK SO TOO
THAT'S FOR THE VOLUME
THE SCROLL WHEELS THAT'S COOL
YEAH SCROLL WHEELS UM
YEAH
WE CAN USE MULTIPLE SCROLL WHEELS W IF WE WANT TO
YEAH THAT'S GOOD
BUT I THINK JUST THE VOLUME IS ENOUGH
YEAH
UH FOR CHANNELS IT'S NOT HANDY BECAUSE YOU SCROLL TOO FAST
OKAY
AND UH THE L. C. D.
SO WE NEED UH THE EXPENSIVE MOST EXPENSIVE CHIP IF WE USE AN L. C. D.
MM
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THAT TO TO PUT IT IN
I DON'T THINK THAT'S AN OPPORTUNITY
JUST SKIP IT
OKAY THEN WE WE USE M MUST USE THE SECOND MOST EXPENSIVE CHIP
BECAUSE WE USE SCROLL WHEELS
SO TH SO THE REGULAR CHIP
YEAH OKAY
OKAY
AND UM
UH ARE ARE WE USING A A RUBBER CASE OR WE HAVEN'T DECIDED YET
YEAH THAT WAS IT I GUESS
OKAY
OH JUST SK MAYBE YOU HAVE TO SKIP THAT ONE AS WELL
IT'S
UH I DON'T THINK A RUBBER CASE LOOKS
UH BUT WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE TREND
AND UH NOW WE HAVE NOTHING ABOUT UH ABOUT THOSE THOSE TWO
THE TREND IS UH SPONG SPONGY UH AND UH FRUIT OR FRESH FRESH
YOU SAID SO
L YEAH I IT IT SHOULD BE SOFT
YEAH OKAY
THAT UH FRUIT AND VEG OR
YEAH FRUIT AND VEG CAN BE JUST THE COVERS
UH YEAH I JUST JUST ON FRONT
SO YOU CAN THE THE SPONGY YEAH I DUNNO
I CAN'T IMAGINE A SOFT REMOTE CONTROL
NO
NEITH UH I DON'T LIKE IT UH NEITHER
NO
I JUST CAN'T IMAGINE IT
OKAY
SO JUST HARD PLASTIC
YEAH
YEAH I THINK
TITANIUM
IT'S MENTIONED HERE UH
TITANIUM UH I THINK IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE
JUST A BIT
BUT MAYBE THE FORM HAS TO BE A BIT DIFFERENT
NOT THE SH THE SQUARE FORM
BUT JUST IN TWO D. NOT IN DEPTH
YEAH YOU CAN MAKE IT CURVED OR MM ROUND
MORE ROUNDED
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
OKAY
SO
SO THE ENERGY UH IS THE RECHARGER
WE ALREADY KNOW THAT
WHAT EXACTLY
OKAY
THE CHIP ON PRINT IS A NORMAL ONE
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO KNOW IT
WE HAVE TO DECIDE WHICH ONE WE'RE GOING TO CHOOSE FROM THESE
JUST A NORMAL BATTERY
YEAH
WE HAVE BATTERIES
YEAH
REGULAR
OKAY THE CASE IS JUST A PLASTIC ONE
YOU HAVE THE SIMPLE ONE REGULAR AND ADVANCED
SO IT'S B SHOULD BE REGULAR UH THE SECOND
YEAH TH YEAH THE CHIP IS THE THE REGULAR ONE
YEAH RE YEAH REGULAR
YEAH OKAY
YEAH REGULAR
OKAY
I THINK I'LL JUST CHECK IT
AND WE NEED A PLASTIC CASE WITH A SCROLL WHEEL
YES
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT
YEAH
USER INTERFACE CONCEPT
AND A FLASHY LIGHT
SO UH I'M NOT SURE
BUT
BUT WE DO I DON'T KNOW IF WE EXPECTED TO DRAW ON THIS ONE AT THIS MOMENT
I DUNNO EITHER
OR SHOULD WE DO IT IN THE NEXT MEETING
MM
UH I. D. AND U. I. D. WORK TOGETHER ON PROTOTYPE DRAWING ON SMART BOARD
THAT'S FOR THE NEXT ONE
THAT'S FOR TH
YEAH
SO WE SHOULD DID IT HERE
SO WE'RE STAYING HERE
OR SHOULD WE DO IT IN THE NEXT MEETING
UH THAT I THINK THAT'S THE NEXT NEXT MEETING
OKAY
BUT YOU DEFINITELY GET A SPECIFIC INSTRUCTION
OKAY SO NOW WE'RE KA THIRTY MINUTES ALONE AGAIN
YEAH
BUT TH THINK ABOUT SOMETHING THAT'S MORE ROUNDED
JUST AND MORE
BUT THE IPOD AND ETCETERA M. P. THREE PLAYERS MOBILE PHONES
YEAH UH I DUNNO
IT HAS TO BE
JUST JUST ON THE TOP OR ON THE BOTTOM
UH A BIT
JUST A BIT CUR OKAY I'LL SEE IF I CAN SEE ANY OF THOSE
O UM IF YOU DRAW IT LIKE THIS YOU GET A
MAYBE THE WHEEL CAN BE UH LIKE UH LIKE THIS
WHAT THE FUCK IS IT
MM
OKAY
IF I DRAW HERE
DOESN'T WORK
YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN
WHAT
IT DRAWS ABOUT FOUR CENTIMETRES LOWER THAN NAH OKAY
JUST
OH
OKAY
MAYBE YOU CAN MAKE IT LIKE THIS
YEAH BUT JUST NOT ON THE TOP BUT UH ON THE SIDE OF IT
AND THIS IS ALL THE WHEEL FOR VOLUME
SO THAT YOU JUST UM IT'S ALL ROUNDED SO YOU CAN DO UH TURN THIS ONE
LIKE A VERY BIG SCROLL WHEEL
OKAY
MAYBE I DUNNO
HMM
OKAY SO WE HAVE THIS AT THE MOMENT
I THINK UH YOU'LL GET A A LOT OF UH VOLUME CHANGING WHEN IT'S NOT WANTED
YEAH YOU YEAH
IS THAT OKAY
OKAY SO WE'D HAVE THIS
YEAH
YEAH BUT MAYBE WE CAN MAKE A A PLASTIC SO THAT YOU I IF YOU LIKE DROP IT IT WON'T CHANGE THE VOLUME
I THINK IT'S PROBABLY BETTER
ONLY IF YOU USE YOUR FINGER
YEAH THAT'S A LITTLE PROBLEM OF COURSE AS WELL
AND
YEAH MAYBE YOU JUST HAVE TO MAKE IT UH
THAT'S NOT SCROLLABLE TOO EASY
LIKE THIS
WHERE DO WE UH PUT THAT
AND UH WHAT'S THE CHANNEL CHOOSE
I THINK IN MIDDLE
STILL ON THE BOTTOM OR
UH WH WHAT IS THE MIDDLE PART
THAT'S THE NUMBERS
UH I THINK TH THE NUMBERS SHOULD BE IN THE BOTTOM AND AND THE SWITCH CHANNEL IN THE MIDDLE
NUMBERS OKAY
YEAH I AGREE AS WELL
USE THE DZ
BECAUSE YOU ALREADY HAVE THE VOLUME HERE SO YOU CAN ALSO PUT IT HERE ONE BUTT AND THE OTHER ONE THERE
IT DOESN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE IF YOU PUT THE S UH THE SWITCH CHANNELS ON SIDE OF EACH OTHER OR ON TOP OF EACH OTHER
SO YOU CAN ALSO CAN PUT IT ALL ON THE TOP AND THIS YOU KEEP THIS EMPTY
NEXT TO EACH OTHER
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO HOLD IT AS WELL
BACK AND FORTH
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
OR YOU COULD DO THE SWITCH CHANNEL UP BUTTON ABOVE THE THE NUMBERS AND SWITCH CHANNEL DOWN BUTTON BELOW
BUT THAT'S NOT WANT TO ZAP VERY QUICK SO
YEAH I THINK UH ZAPPING IS THE HIGHEST PRIORITY
AND THEN YOU USE THOSE UH
YEAH OKAY
YEAH
IS THIS A OPPORTUNITY OR YOU DON'T WANT A DIFFERENT
YEAH OF COURSE UH
UH BUT I THINK WE WE SHOULD BU UH PUT 'EM ON TOP OF EACH OTHER SO
WHY
BECAUSE THEN IT'S IT'S EASY TO KNOW M IF I PUSH THE THE THE UP
BUT STILL THE NEXT IT'S STILL THE NEXT ONE
DOESN'T MAKE
YEAH BUT THE TOP THE TOP BUTTON IS IS LIKE YOU SWITCH CHANNEL UP AND DOWN BUTTON IS IF YOU PUT THEM
YEAH BUT FO FROM LEFT TO RIGHT IS EXACTLY THE SAME
IT MA IT DOESN'T MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE
I I THINK IT'S
YEAH
BUT UH BUT I I THINK UH LEFT TO RIGHT IS MORE OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH VOLUME AND TOP DOWN IS MORE WITH UH CHANNEL CHANGING
IT'S IT'S OBVIOUS I THINK
EVERY REMOTE CONTROL'S UH DIFFERENT
YEAH THAT'S NOT NOT IT'S NOT AL UH ALWAYS THE SAME
BUT IT'S EXACTLY TH
IN UH ON MOST ON MOST REMOTE CONTROLS
SO SO IF WE USE THAT THEY WILL PROBABLY HAVE A LONG LEARNING UH TIME
YEAH I THINK
I YOU ALREADY HAVE THE VOLUME ON THE SIDE SO YOU CAN'T MAKE IT YOU CAN'T MA MAKE A MISTAKE
I DUNNO
SO IT'S UH
NO UH I THINK
I THINK IT'S S SO SIMPLE YOU JUST
YEAH
I DUNNO
OKAY
SO BUT THAT'S FOR THAT'S FOR YOU 'CAUSE IT'S
YEAH OKAY I'LL D I'LL TAKE A LOOK AT IT
OKAY SO HMM
WHAT DID WHAT ELSE WE HAVE TO DISCUSS ABOUT
I DUNNO
THINK WE NEED TO WORK UH THIRTY MINUTES AGAIN
YEAH WE HAVE TO CARE THAT IT R UH LOOKS REALLY NEW
BECAUSE UH WE STILL HOLD ON TO THE UH ORDINARY UH
'CAUSE WHA WHAT I SEE THE ONLY DIFFERENCE I I I IN FACT IS THAT WE USE A SCROLL WHEEL ON THE OUTSIDE
UH SQUARE UH REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH
AND THE LED
YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT IMAGE OF THE IPOD
NO YOU HAVE UH IT IS UH THE CURRENT UH CONTROLLERS ARE ALL BLACK AND PLASTIC
SO
YEAH BUT I I IT SHOULD BE ROUND IN IN SHAPE
OKAY
YES
MORE THAT UH KIND OF STYLE
AND A BIT UH
NOT NOT THE OLD GREY BLACK
UH YEAH
SOME SOME KIND OF BLING BLING UH MM CAN WE HAVE
WHERE YOU CAN PUT A VE UH WE HAVE IF WE DO IT LIKE THAT WE HAVE BELOW HAVE WE UH A LOT OF ROOM TO PUT A NICE LOGO
UH THE LOGO WAS HAS TO BE ON THERE
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
UH AND HOW MANY UH FRONTS UH FRONTS DO WE PUT ON THE MARKET THEN
UH FIVE OR SOMETHING
OR MORE OR
YEAH FIVE
LET'S GIVE FIVE
MAYBE YOU CAN BUY SEPARATE ONES AND UH
OR YOU CAN CHOOSE ONE UH IF YOU BUY THE PROJECT
AND UH BASIC
AND UM UH UH BUY THE PRODUCT
YOU BUY YOU GET ONE
YEAH
UM I THINK YEAH
NO THA THAT WILL BE
THAT'S YOUR CHOICE I THINK HUH
IS THAT IS THAT A GOOD GOOD OPPORTUNITY
SO YOU COULD PUT IT LIKE THAT OKAY
SO Y YOU CAN PUT THE BOTTOM OF THE REMOTE CONTROL IN RECHARGER
YES
YEAH SO TOP DOWN
HMM
YEAH YOU SL UH YOU LET IT SLIDE IN THE DOCKING STATION
DO WE HAVE TO DESIGN THAT W AS WELL
YEAH
UH I'M NOT SURE
THE DOCKING STATION
YEAH I THINK SO
HMM
YEAH WE CAN B
BUT TH YEAH THAT CAN BE VERY SIMPLE
LEAST
IT C IT COULD BE JUST JUST A SQUARE JUST A PACKET
YEAH JUST A RECHARGER
YEAH JUST WHERE YOU'RE AROUND SOMETHING
LI YEAH WE HAD ONE EXAMPLE
BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE CONTACTS ON THE ON THE REMOTE CONTROL AND THE RECHARGER AS WELL
MM
MM
YEAH BUT THAT'S A ROUND ONE
MAYBE WE CAN CHOOSE THEN
WHICH W
HERE YOU SEE ONE THAT'S VERY ROUND
OH YEAH OKAY
SO I THINK THAT CAN BE ALL KIND OF SHAPES
BUT MAYBE YOU CAN JUST ROUND UP THE CORNERS A BIT
OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH
THAT'S ALL
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
JUST ROUND IT UP
BUT
YEAH SO Y YOU DON'T WANT UH THIS UH LIKE THE IPOD
YEAH
NO
YEAH
MORE ROUNDED
SINCE IT'S THIS IS ALSO ROUNDED
I THINK I
YEAH I THINK IT WILL JUST LOOK LIKE MORE LIKE THIS ONE
NO JUST JUST THE CORNERS
YEAH OKAY THO THOSE ARE AL ALREADY A BIT CORNERED
MM
OKAY
YEAH BUT WE CAN WE CAN DO ALL KINDS OF UH AS LONG AS IT ISN IS IN TWO D. WE CAN USE ALL KIND OF ROUND SHAPES
SHAPES
YEAH OKAY BUT THEN WE HAVE TO THINK OF SOMETHING TOTALLY NEW
NOT IN DEPTH
YEAH BUT YEAH IF IF WE WANT TO MAKE IT
KIND OF YEAH NEW
I'VE UH I HAD A LOT OF PICTURE OF OLD ONES
AND ALL CURVES HAVE ALREADY BEEN DONE
IT'S A BIT ANNOYING ISN'T IT
YEAH
JUST JUST MORE LIKE THIS AND NOT UH A SQUARE
OKAY
HMM
WHAT DO WE DO WRONG
YEAH OKAY YEAH WELL
YEAH BUT WE COULD DO A LOT OF LOT MORE CURVING
I WOULD DO IT
YEAH
I KNOW WE CAN DO A LOT MORE BUT
YEAH IT
LIKE IN THIS KIND OF SHAPE OR
OKAY
UH IT'S VERY ANNOYING
I DUNNO
I DUNNO IF IT'S HANDY
I THINK IT WILL ONLY LOOK MORE LIKE THE OLD REMOTE CONTROLS
UH
THE OLDEN THE OLDEN ONES HAD LOOKED LIKE JUST A SQUARE THING
THIS
YEAH
BUT UH I HAD A LOT OF PICTURES OH I CAN SHOW YOU HERE
YEAH OKAY
WHAT THE OLD ONES LOOK LIKE
MM
CURVES CURVES
YEAH
YOU'VE MORE THERE AS WELL
YEAH OKAY
IT WASN'T VERY SMALL ONE
YEAH
VERY SIMPLE
THAT IS FOR ELDERLY
SO WE HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION WHAT KIND OF FORM IT'S GONNA HAVE T GOING TO HAVE
YEAH I DON'T KNOW
YEAH
IF WE JUST UH TAKE THE IPOD AND THE SAME LOOK
SO UH LIGHT OR JUST WHATEVER COLOUR BUT THE SAME LIGHT COLOURS
I THINK IF W MY OPINION
YEAH
MM-HMM
MORE LIKE THE M. P. THREE PLAYER M. UM P. M. P. THREE PLAYER
NO RUBBER BUTTONS OR SOMETHING
JUST TOGETHER WITH THE BACK LIGHTS YOU'LL GET A TOTALLY NEW LOOK
AND UH JUST WITH UH TOGETHER WITH UH THE BACK LIGHTS B LOOK WILL LOOK VERY NEW
YEAH
AND YOU HAVE THE SCROLL BUTTON INSIDE
BUT WHY DO WE HAVE TO ROUND IT ON THE T BOTTOM THEN
OKAY
OF SKIP THAT ONE AS WELL
YES
JUST A SIMPLE SCROLLB
YEAH
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE
OKAY
YEAH IT'S COOL
IF WE WANT TO MAKE IT
YEAH THOUGH THAT'S A TREND
BUT YEAH I'M NOT A TRENDWATCHER YOU ARE
SO
UH THE T THE TREND IS
RUBBER SPONGY
SPONGY AND FRUITY
BUT YEAH
YEAH
SPONGY AND
NO
SPONGEBALL KINDA
IT'S NOT NOT A LOT OF TRENDS I UH I FOUND UH
SO JUST I THINK IT'S OKAY IF YOU JUST KEEP IT A BIT SQUARE
OKAY SO WE HAVE S STILL ONE MINUTE LEFT
UH
MM
OKAY
YEAH I D I DON'T KNOW N SOMETHING ABOUT ERGONOMIC KIND OF FITS IN THE HAND UH STUFF
IT THE TH TH
NO
YEAH
IT'S ONLY ANNOYING IF IT IF IT'S LIKE THAT F FORMED LIKE THAT LIKE F WHATEVER
BUT I I THINK IT'S STILL FOR OLDER PEOPLE
JUST YOU HAVE A NORMAL
YOU J STILL HAVE OLDER PEOPLE
THERE IS ONE
YEAH BUT WE'RE WE'RE AIMING AT A YOUNG PUBLIC
THERE'S JUST ONE OVERALL IMPORTANT ASPECT IS THAT WE MUST MAKE IT FANCY AND IT LOOKS ORIGINAL
AND I HOPE WE CAN UH MAKE IT LOOK NOT LIKE THE IPOD ITSELF
IT MUST HAVE UH UH UH A VERY DIFFERENT
BUT YOU'RE IF YOU LOOK AT THE WAY REMOTE CONTROLS ARE NOW
YEAH IDEA
YEAH THEY'RE ALL THE SAME
AND IF YOU MAKE IT LOOK LIKE THE IPOD
MAKE IT IN IN YELLOW OR SOMETHING
UH MAYBE MAYBE MAKE THE THE MM THE WHA WHAT'S IT CALLED UH SCROLL WHEEL
THAT'S ALREADY FANCY
JUST LIKE THE COLOURS OF REAL REACTION
BUT I IT IS IT IS IT IS ALREADY FANCY
BECAUSE OF THE LIGHTS ON THE BOTTOM OF IT
SO THAT'S ALREADY A VERY BIG CHANGE COMPARED TO
YEAH OKAY
HMM
YE YEAH
WELL UH
YEAH WE COULD DO THAT
COULD
UH YEAH BUT UH IF YOU THE F UH FRONT THE SCROLL WHEEL WILL STILL UH BE YELLOW
YEAH
NO I THINK OH
IT'S RIGHT
THINK THE SCROLL WHEEL WON'T BE VERY BIG
SO IT WILL JUST BE A SMALL
SINCE IF YOU PUT IT UH SOMEWHERE THE CHANCES THAT IT WILL SCROLL ARE TOO BIG
YEAH
SO IT WON'T UH STICK OUT MUCH
SMALL SCROLL WHEEL
MAYBE THE ONES WE ARE GOING TO DRAW THERE
YEAH
MAYBE WE HAVE TO ASK UH TO THE THE MM TO HER IF IT HAS IF IT CAN WORK BETTER THAN THIS
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T WORK PROPERLY
NO
SO MAYBE YOU HAVE TO ASK HER
YEAH OKAY
WELL MAYBE WE CAN JUST OPEN IMAGES THERE AND I'LL PAINT AND PAINT
THAT'S PROBABLY
OKAY
YEAH
I'LL BE ABLE TO DO A BETTER JOB
IF YOU SET THE PEN YEAH HE WILL DRAW HERE
DOESN'T WORK
OKAY SO JUST FINISH IT
SO WE MAKE IT A BIT LIKE M THAT ONE PROBABLY
YEAH I'LL SEE IT
YEAH
IS THAT OKAY
BU YEAH I AGREE MORE LIKE IPOD
YEAH
OKAY ONLY THE COLOUR AND THE FLASHY LIGHT AND THE WE JUST WE JUST SKIP THE THE THE VOCA OR WAS IT THE THE SPEECH RECOGNITION
JUST A
YES
YEAH DO WE S KEEP THAT
SPEECH
YEAH I THINK
IT'S OKAY
OR KEEP THAT
BUT YOU'D DEFINITELY NEED A
YEAH I THINK SO
S UH YEAH I DON'T KNOW
AND WE WE HAVE TO BUILD IN A MICROPHONE AND
WELL UH THEN IT W
ADVANCED CHIP
UH
WE ALREADY HAVE UH THE BEEPING OF THE HOME STATION SO
WELL THAT'S VERY EASY
I D I DIDN'T RECEIVE ANY INFORMATION ON SPEECH RECOGNITION SO
YEAH AND I DO I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT
NO
UH STRANGE THAT I RECEIVED THE INFORMATION ABOUT THAT
BUT
OH THAT'S HARD
SO
UH THE MA THE MAIN POINTS I I I UH JUST SAID
BECAU YEAH
BUT
WE HAVE TO BE ORIGINAL AND UH TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIVE
CAN WE JUST PUT IT SPEECH RECOGNITION IN IT AS WELL OKAY
MA
SO SHALL WE IT OPEN THEN
SO WE CAN PUT ALL THE
YEAH
THE FUNCTION OF THAT IN THERE
YEAH
OKAY
AND WE NEED A PROBABLY WE NEED A UH ADVANCED CHIP THEN
FINE
YEAH WE PROBABLY DO
BUT IT DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT IT DOES IT
YEAH
NO
OH YEAH I
BUT WE DON'T HAVE ANY F INFORMATION ABOUT THE COST
NO
WE STARTED WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THE COST WAS NOW TH
I JUST I JUST RECEIVED THE
YEAH UH I HAVE I HAVE SOME SOME INFORMATION ABOUT THE COST
BUT JUST A ABOUT THE CHIP
YEAH
THE THE THE
AND HOW MUCH IS THE CHIP
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH BUT
THIS IS A VERY SMALL ELECTRONIC UNIT WILL GIVE A STANDARD ANSWER AFTER IT RECOGNISE A QUESTION
YEAH OUR DIVISION HAS DEVELOPED A NEW SPEECH RECOGNITION FEATURE THE INTEGRATED PROGRAMMABLE SAMPLE SENSOR SIMPLE SPEAKER U UNIT
JUST IN INEXPENSIVE OR
AND HOW HOW DOES IT WORK
IS IT
JUST YOU SAY RECORD FOLLOWED BY YOUR QUESTION SAMPLE AND AFTER A FEW SECONDS THE ANSWER UH SAMPLE
DOESN'T SAY
BECAUSE UH
SO IT WORKS LIKE UH GOOD MORNING REMOTE CONTROL AND THEN THE REMOTE CONTROL SAYS GOOD MORNING
IT DOESN'T HAS TO SAY ANYTHING
JUST YOU HAVE TO JUST TALK TO
NO
DOES IT SAY DOES IT SAY SOMETHING BACK
YEAH UH TH THAT'S JUST IT'S A NO
YEAH IT WELL THAT'S INTEGRATED IN THE CHIP SO IF YOU USE THE SPEECH RECOGNITION THAT'S IN IT
OKAY WE HAVE TO STOP IT NOW
SO JUST
OKAY THAT'S A R THAT'S THAT'S A ADVANCED
BUT I IT'S A SEPARATE CHIP
I DUNNO BUT IF WE USE SPEECH RECOGNITION THAT WILL BE IN IT AS WELL
OKAY
YEAH I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS BUT NAH
UM
YEAH WE JUST DECIDE NOT TO PUT IT IN BECAUSE IT'S TOO DIFFICULT
I DUNNO
WELL IT IT WOULD BE WOULD BE A GOOD FEATURE FEATURE
YEAH
WE HAVE TO STOP NOW
OKAY WE JUST PUT IT IN BECAUSE IT'S A GOOD FEATURE
OKAY JUST WE HAVE TO STOP IT NOW
OKAY
AND THERE'S A CHIP IN IT THAT WILL OKAY
NO NO WORRIES ABOUT THE COST ETCETERA
FINE
OH
IT'S NOT SAVED YET
OKAY
SO
OKAY
OUR BEAUTIFUL DRAWING
SO JUST F UM
SO THIS IS OUR AGENDA
YOU'RE F YOU'RE GOING TO SHOW YOUR PR PROTOTYPE PRESENTATION AFTER ME
OOPS
OKAY
UH I DIDN'T OH YEAH
SO THESE ARE THE
YEAH
OH OKAY
SO THESE ARE THE UM LAST NOTES WE I MADE
IF ANYTHING DOESN'T LOOK RIGHT JUST SAY IT TO ME THEN
I DON'T HAVE TO PUT IT IN THE REPORT
BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO UH DE UM DESIGN THE INSIDE AS WELL
ARE WE DOING THE THE SPEECH RECOGNITION
SO IF YOU WANT TO IT'S OKAY
OKAY BUT IT'S STILL POSSIBLE UH UH FINANCIALLY
WELL THEN THEN WE'RE GONNA PUT IT IN
OKAY YEAH
OKAY JUST
YEAH JUST UH WE HAVE TO DESIGN THE INSIDE THEN BUT IT SHOULD BE UH
YEAH AND OR ARE WE MAKING A SLIDE OPEN LIKE UNDERNEATH
I DON'T KNOW
OR FOLD OPEN
SLIDE OPEN IS UH QUITE USABLE FOR REMOTE CONTROLS
IT'S PROBABLY BETTER
YEAH S LIKE UNDERNEATH UH YOU CAN SLIDE IT OPEN AND YOU OTHER FUNCTIONS
IT'S MAY MAYBE UH A BIT STRONGER AS WELL
MAYBE THAT'S BETTER
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S THAT'S A VERY GOOD POINT
OKAY SO WHEN YOU HAVE A LOT OF ROOM INSIDE
SO YOU CAN MAKE IT VERY EASY TO USE
'CAUSE YOU CAN WRITE A LOT OF COMMENTS BESIDES IT
THINK THAT'S BETTER
YEAH
SO THIS IS OKAY
OKAY
NO
YEAH WE'RE GONNA USE THE ADVANCED CHIP THEN
NO YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT CHIP FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION
OKAY SO THAT'S UH I'LL JUST HAVE A LOOK HOW MUCH THAT IS
SO
BUT UM OKAY FOR THE OKAY
THE
ADVANCED CHIP WAS FOR UH SPEE YEAH
YEAH I I THINK SO
I DON'T KNOW
OKAY
AH OKAY
SO I ALREADY CALCULATED THAT AND IT'S STILL IN THE BUDGET
SO IT'S OKAY
GOOD
SO YOU CAN SHOW YOUR PROTOTYPE IF YOU WANT TO
YEAH
TOGETHER
OKAY
YEAH IT'S LET'S DO IT TOGETHER
I'LL GIVE COMMENTS
YEAH WE JUST MADE A WORD FILE
WITH THE BASIC
ELEMENTS
SO THAT'S BASICALLY IT
UH THE LOOK AND FEEL MODEL
UH THE MATERIAL SHOULD BE HARD PLASTIC
UH WELL THE FORM THE CASE UM AS DRAWN THERE
SIMPLY A SQUARE WITH UH ROUND CORNERS
MM-HMM
UH COLOUR CHANGEABLE AND ALSO TRANSPARENT
UM THEN THE ELEMENTS
AND COLOUR AND TRANSPARENT OR JUST TRANSPARENT I DON'T KNOW
UH WE HAVE
LIKE UH I'VE POINTED THEM HERE
THE FUNCTIONS ARE JUST BASIC
MUTE FUNCTION ON OFF FUNCTION TEXT FUNCTIONS
AND THIS IS THE
THIS UH SWITCH CHANNEL
OKAY COOL
THE NUM PAD
AND THE LOGO IS OVER HERE AND THE MIC
OKAY
YOU OPERATE THAT WITH YOUR POINTING FINGER
AND THE SCROLLWHEEL NO
SO YOU HOLD IT LIKE THIS IN YOUR RIGHT HAND AND
MEANS
MM
SO HOW MANY FUNCTIONS DO YOU NEED FOR FOR UH THE MICROPHONE
SPEECH RECOGNITION
YEAH SPEECH RECOGNITION
JUST ONLY ONE BUTTON TO SAY IT'S ON OR OFF
BUT UM I CAN IMAGINE THAT YOU HAVE TO INPUT YOUR VOICE OR SOMETHING
UM I DIDN'T HAVE A SPECIFICATION OF THAT
UM SO I'VE
UH I DUNNO
YEAH MAYBE MAYBE UH YOU HAVE TO CONFIGURE IT
YES YOU NEED OPTIONS TO CONFIGURE IT AND AFTER THAT YOU DON'T NEED 'EM ANYMORE
SO YOU CAN PUT IT ON THE BACK AS WELL IF YOU WANT TO
YEAH YOU CAN PUT 'EM ALL ON THE BACK
THAT'S FOR SURE
WELL WE HAVEN'T HAD TIME TO DESIGN THAT THE SLIDE PAD
YEAH OR OR ON THE SLIDE FUNCTION I DON'T KNOW
OKAY
THAT'S UH
OKAY
WE ALSO DON'T KNOW HOW MANY BUTTONS ARE REQUIRED OR WHAT KIND OF BUTTONS
BUT
YOU HAVE A LOT OF ROOM IF YOU CAN SLIDE IT OPEN
YEAH YOU CAN PUT IT SEPARATE
SO BUT IT'S ENOUGH ROOM
I CAN IMAGINE YOU NEED AT LEAST FOUR BUTTONS OR SOMETHING
YOU YEAH I KNOW
YEAH
YEAH YOU WRITE UH YOU WROTE THIS SO
UM THE POSITION
UH WELL WELL THE MAIN THE MAIN ZAP BUTTONS ARE MOST CENTRAL
TEXT BUTTONS MUTE BUTTONS ARE TOGETHER AND AT A PLACE THEY EASILY ARE EASY TO FIND
SO UH THE BEST PLACE THE BEST REACH PLACE UM ON OFF BUTTONS
THAT WAS THE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
UM THE ON OFF BUTTON IS A BIT BIGGER UH SO IT STANDS OUT
THAT WAY YOU DON'T HAVE TO MAKE IT RED 'CAUSE IT'S
WILL UH WILL SHOW UP
UH SCROLLWHEEL IS ON THE LEFT SIDE
IT'S BASICALLY THE BE STANDARD PLACE FOR SCROLLWHEEL AS FAR AS I KNOW
BUT IT'S NOT UH IMPOSSIBLE TO USE IT IF YOU'RE LEFT HANDED
YEAH
SO Y BECAUSE YOU CAN USE YOUR THUMB THEN
YEAH
BUT YOU MISSED THE NO UH THE ZERO AND UH THE TWO STRIPES
JUST JUST ONE THING NOW
UM Y YOU NEED TO HAVE MORE UH ONE TWO TH YOU'VE GOT ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT NINE
OKAY YEAH THEY
MM YEAH
THAT'S THAT'S BELOW THAT THEN
YEAH OKAY
IT'S UH TWELVE BUTTONS
YEAH OKAY
JUST SO YOU GET THAT
OKAY BUT
IT'S RATHER IMPORTANT
YEAH
YEAH OKAY JUST WE JUST MISSED THAT
BUT UM I'LL JUST UH
I'LL GET BACK TO LATER
SO UM SHOULD BE POPULAR
F THE FORM WELL WE'VE TAKEN THAT FROM THE IPOD OTHER POPULAR TECHNICAL DEVICE
UM
THE F UH THE BUTTONS CREATING
UH IF YOU
THAT OR ALL ROUND SHAPES NOT UH ROUNDED CORNERS
OKAY
SO THAT YOU KNOW YOU GET A BIT ROUND FEELING
UM WE'LL USE HARD PLASTIC
SINCE THAT ALLOWS US TO USE UH TWO D. BUTTONS UH NON RUBBER BUTTONS
WELL AND UM THE BACKLIGHT THING THE THING THAT LIGHTS UP
COLOUR CHANGEABLE
WE HAVE DECIDED UH IN THE THE CHANNEL BUTTONS THERE'S A LITTLE UH COLOUR AROUND IT
OKAY
AND ALSO IN THE NUM PADS THERE'S ALSO COLOUR LIGHT BEHIND IT
AND DO YOU STILL CAN DO YOU STILL CAN CHOOSE WHAT COLOUR KIND OF COLOUR YOU WANT
JUST ON THE MAYBE ON THE SECOND LEVEL AS WELL
HOW DO YOU WANT TO IMPLEMENT THAT
SO WHEN YOU PRE
YEAH
MM JUST A LITTLE
YEAH
WE'RE GOING TO IMPLEMENT
AH
YEAH THESE ARE JUST BASIC FUNCTIONS SO ALL THE NON BASIC ARE IN
OKAY JUST DRAW DRAW THE SECOND LEVEL BECAUSE WE NEED THAT AS WELL
YEAH
OKAY
UM
PLAY STATION OR UH D. V. D. PLAYER
OKAY THERE IS ONE UH FUNCTION I USE UH DAILY AND IT'S NOT ON THE BASIC FUNCTIONS
IT'S UH TO SWITCH TO UH UH YOUR SCART
THAT FUNCTION MUST BE
OKAY MAYBE WE USE THIS BUTTON FOR THE
YEAH MAYBE OR YOU CAN UH I UH LAY IT UH BENEATH IN THE UH OTHER UH FUNCTIONS
YEAH I UM TO YOUR VIDEO DEVICE
JUST MAKE MAKE A JUST JUST DRAW A SECOND LEVEL ONE AND SAY ALL OPTIONS THAT ARE STILL LEFT OR SOMETHING
YEAH AS WELL
YEAH
OKAY
A SECOND LEVEL
LIKE A A NEW BLANK ONE OR OR JUST HERE
YEAH
YEAH
SO UH
NO NO JUST ON DOWN THERE
IS I AH OKAY
YEAH
AND H HOW DOES THE SECOND LEVEL COME OUT
UH IT SLIDES UH ALONG
JUST UH IF YOU S
IT'S
UM SLIDES I THINK
YEAH Y MAYBE YEAH
FROM FROM THE UH BENEATH
FOR THE BOTTOM
IF THAT BREAKS THEN YOU'RE SCREWED
YOU CAN DO IT THAT IT CLAPS OPEN BUT I THINK THAT'S NOT SOLID ENOUGH
NO YOU GOTTA SLIDE IT
YEAH IT'S RIGHT
UM
SO IT DO DOESN'T EVEN HAVE TO SLIDE ALL THE WAY OPEN
SO WHAT DO WE NEED
UH I THE THE SPEECH FUNCTIONS BUTTONS
YEAH JUST
MENU
MENU BUTTON
WITH UH MAYBE UH ARROWS
SO YOU CAN UH
SCROLL IN THE NAVIGATE THE MENU
UM
GOD DAMN IT
SCART
SO YOU HAVE ONE LEFT FOR THE RIGHT THE VIDEO CHANNEL PLAY STATION ETCETERA
THAT'S USED PRETTY OFTEN
I THINK WE CAN EVEN PUT A WE HAVE ONE FOR THE ZERO AND ONE FOR THE FOR THE MORE DIGIT UH CHANNELS
UH YEAH
YES
AND SO Y YOU KEEP YOU KEEP ONE YOU HAVE ONE LEFT
SO THIS IS THE
YEAH
IT'S A F BASIC UH
IF YOU HAVE A PLAY STATION MM YOU USE IT EVERY DAY
YEAH
EXTERN OR SOMETHING
YOU WANT TO SAVE THAT FILE AS WELL
THE DRAWING
THAT WAS IT
SO HERE ARE MULTIPLE SPEECH BUTTONS I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY
UH
JUST JUST UH
DOESN'T REALLY MATTER
I DON'T KNOW THE FUNCTIONS
OKAY
WHAT ELSE
WHAT ELSE
UH MENU BUTTONS WITH ARROWS
THAT'S YEAH WELL WE DON'T HAVE ANY UH HMM
IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER
WHAT ELSE
UH MENU
YEAH TO NAVIGATE
UH WITH ARROWS
S JUST UH LIKE UM I THINK IT'S BEST IF WE DO
MM WHERE DO WE HAVE
OR THERE
LIKE A NORMAL UM
LIKE ON THE NORMAL UH LIKE THIS
YEAH WITH IN THE MIDDLE UM A MENU BUTTON
OKAY
THE MENU BUTTON YES
SO YOU CAN'T REDESIGN IT
WELL WE DON'T HAVE ANY ANYTHING ON HOW MANY BUTTONS SPEECH REQUIRES
MM OKAY
YEAH
MAYBE ONE BUTTON TO SWITCH THE COLOUR OF YOUR UH LEDS
YEAH
YEP
UH AND AND YOU CAN HOLD IT YOU CAN HOLD IT AND THEN THE COLOURS SWITCH OR MM MULTIPLE MULTIPLE BUTTONS
YEAH
JUST PRESS IT ONCE THE COLOUR SHOULD UH SWITCH
PRESS AGAIN THE COLOUR SWITCH AGAIN MAYBE
OKAY
OR WE JUST MAKE IT THREE BUTTONS ALL THE COLOURS ON IT
JUST RED YEL UH RED GREEN AND
IF WE HAVE ENOUGH PLACE UH THEN WE CAN DO THAT
OKAY YEAH
TH YEAH
YEAH OKAY
THAT'S THAT'S VERY EASY YEAH
WE CAN PUT THOSE HERE
AND THEN WE CHOOSE GREEN UH BLUE AND RED OR OKAY
COLOUR BUTTONS
YEAH
YEP
OKAY
THAT'S UH UM
OKAY
SO DID WE MISS ANYTHING
YEAH MAYBE SOME UH SOME TEXT NEXT TO THE SCROLL WHEEL THAT IT IS VOLUME
IT
SOME TEXT UH BUTTONS
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH BUT
I JUST UH THE VOLUME LOGO
NO MA ON ON O ON THE ON THE
THERE'S ONE THERE'S ONE TEXT BUTTON I
OH WH HERE
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
JUST MAKE IT
DO YOU DO YOU DID YOU THINK OF THAT

YEAH
NO
SO I THINK IT'S EASY TO USE BUT AND LEARNABLE IS A BIT
LEARNABLE
I THINK UH YOU MUST UH SEEK FOR IT AND UP OR DOWN OR UH THEN THE RE
BECAUSE BECAUSE I THINK I THINK THE SCROLL WHEEL UH IT'S VERY HANDY

BUT BUT BUT I THINK THIS PART
OKAY
YEAH BUT I THINK OH NO YOU MADE ANOTHER MISTAKE
YEAH THERE ARE A LOT OF MISTAKES BECAUSE THE WALLS ARE THICK LIKE THIS
OH
NO I W OKAY I'M NOT THAT WHINY
BUT UH THERE WAS A BIG HOLE HERE AS WELL AND THERE AS WELL
YEAH THEY'RE WALKING BEHIND THE WALLS
OH THAT'S TRUE
UH HERE
THAT'S A KINDA BIG MISTAKE
WARNING FINISH MEETING NOW
GUYS I THINK WE HAVE TO FINISH THE MEETING
OKAY
'KAY THIS IS A HARD ONE
UH
BOOM BOA RING BING
WHAT DOES IT SAY
FILL IN THE QUESTIONNAIRE
WHAT NOW
COME ON
OKAY YEAH
OKAY
YEP
OKAY
NO MORE CHIT CHAT
OH YOU GOTTA FINISH
CHE CHE CHE CHE
OVER THERE
I'M GONNA BE SO LONELY
IN YOUR OWN ROOM
YEAH
TU DUMM
UH
MM I'LL CLEAN THAT UP LATER
THIS IS THAT'S MY NEW INTERFACE
WHAT'S THAT
THAT'S A UH EDITED SMILEY
TOM TI DOM
UH
OKAY
AND WE'RE ACTUALLY MOVING IN THREE WEEKS
AND THEY WANT TO KNOW WHERE WE'RE GONNA DO ALL THIS BY NOVEMBER SECOND
AND THE CATCH IS THAT THEY HAVE THE FINAL APPROVAL OF WHERE WE PUT PEOPLE AND EQUIPMENT
WELL THE BUILDING IS TOO SMALL FOR OUR GROUP
SO WE'RE MOVING TO A NEW BUILDING
UH IT'S GONNA BE THE BUILDING ACROSS THE STREET
THE FAX MACHINE ALL THE BIG EQUIPMENT
SO AS YOU GUYS KNOW F ISSCO IS TOO SMALL
BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO KNOW WHO IS GOING TO BE IN WHAT OFFICE IN THE NEW BUILDING AND WHERE WE'RE G WE'RE GONNA PUT THINGS LIKE THE PRINTER
OKAY
AND SINCE WE DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY OTHER TIME WE HAVE TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS TODAY
SO YOU ACTUALLY GET WINDOWS ON TWO WALLS AND TWO ONE PERSON ROOMS
UM THERE'S TWO VIEWS EITHER OF THE OLD TOWN OR THE MOUNTAINS AND THE ROOMS HAVE VARIOUS SIZES
WHAT WE'RE GETTING IS NINE ROOMS FOR A MAXIMUM OF EIGHTEEN PEOPLE WHICH IS OKAY 'CAUSE THERE'S ONLY FIFTEEN OF US
THERE'S TWO THREE PEOPLE ROOMS FIVE TWO PERSON ROOMS WHICH ARE ON THE CORNERS OF THE BUILDING
SO THAT MEANS BASICALLY NEXT TUESDAY
AND ALL THE ROOMS HAVE WINDOWS LUCKILY SO THERE'S NO FIGHTS ABOUT WHO GETS A WINDOW AND WHO DOESN'T
AND THE EQUIPMENT THAT WE HAVE TO PUT SOMEWHERE ARE LIKE I SAID THE PHOTOCOPIER WHICH IS REALLY BIG
THE FAX MACHINE WHICH IS NOT SO BIG AND THE PRINTER WHICH IS RELATIVELY BIG
UM YOU CAN SEE THE BATHROOMS THE ELEVATORS ARE SORT OF FURTHER DOWN THE HALL
THE PURPLE BAR AT THE BOTTOM SORT OF ON THE RIGHT IS THE MAIL BOXES
UM AND THEN YOU HAVE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE PER ROOM
ALL OF THE WINDOWS OPEN YOU CAN GET OUT ONTO THE TERRACE JUST LIKE WE CAN IN OUR NORMAL BUILDING
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH WHAT THE BUILDING LOOKS LIKE
THE COURTYARD BECAUSE WE'RE ON THE SIXTH FLOOR YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY GO OUT TO IT BUT IT JUST MEANS THAT THE WINDOWS LOOK OUT ONTO OPEN SPACE
NO CUPBOARDS LIKE WE HAVE IN THE CURRENT OFFICES AND EACH PERSON GETS THEIR OWN CHAIR THEIR OWN CORNER DESK
AND BY SMALL I MEAN THEY'RE ABOUT THAT TALL AND ONE SORT OF HANGING SHELF
SO LIKE THE N THE ONES THAT WE HAVE NOW UM A SMALL FILING CABINET WITH THREE DRAWERS
SO WE DON'T GET THE BOOKCASES LIKE WE HAVE NOW BUT JUST ONE SHELF THAT'S ATTACHED TO THE WALL
EACH OFFICE HAS A WHITE BOARD A BULLETIN BOARD AND A COAT RACK
MM-HMM
AND I GUESS THE QUESTION THE FIRST QUESTION IS HOW WE WANT TO ORGANISE PEOPLE
AND THE PEOPLE THAT WE HAVE TO PLACE UH YOU CAN SEE THE LIST THERE ALONG WITH THEIR POSITION AND THE PROJECT THAT THEY WORK ON
WHETHER WE WANT TO DO IT BY RANK OR BY PROJECT OR
SO THE IDEA IS THAT WE COME UP WITH A PLAN
AND THEN ANDRE AND I HAVE TO DO PRESENTATIONS FOR THE UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATORS ON THE SECOND
OKAY
I DON'T KNOW PUT ALL THE P. H. D. STUDENTS TOGETHER ALL THE PROFESSORS TOGETHER THAT SORT OF THING
THERE'S ANOTHER GROUP WHO'S GONNA BE WORKING ON THE SAME PLAN LATER THIS WEEK
SO WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH A PLAN POSSIBLY IF WE HAVE TIME A PRESENTATION
A QUICK PRESENTATION WITH ARGUMENTS FOR WHY WE THINK OUR PLAN WORKS BEST
ALRIGHT
MM-HMM
SO ANYONE HAVE ANY IDEAS OR
I GUESS
UH DO WE KNOW IF THERE WILL BE A LOT OF PEOPLE COMING ACROSS THE HALL IN TERMS OF SECURITY STUFF IF WE CAN I MEAN MY IDEA IS TO PUT THE PHOTOCOPIER AND THE FAX IN THE HALL
UM I THINK IT'S THE SECURITY IS SORT OF THE SAME AS IT IS IN THE CURRENT BUILDING
YEAH
SO AS LONG AS THE THINGS ARE PHYSICALLY ATTACHED TO THE WALL SO THEY CAN'T BE REMOVED THEN IT SHOULD BE OKAY TO LEAVE THEM IN THE HALL
UM
OKAY
MM
WE CAN PUT IT
MM-HMM
OKAY
OKAY
IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF WHETHER YOU ARE PRINTING SENSITIVE DOCUMENTS OR N WHATEVER
MM
MM
MM YEAH
SO WE ONLY GET ONE PRINTER FOR FIFTEEN PEOPLE
UM WELL WE GET ONE SORT OF NETWORKED PRINTER AND THEN I THINK SOME OF US HAVE PERSONAL PRINTERS
I THINK SUSAN HAS A PERSONAL PRINTER GISELLA HAS ONE MAYBE
YEAH
YEAH AND THAT'S IT
YEAH
IN TERMS OF EQUIPMENT IT'S SORT OF THE SAME THING AS WE HAVE NOW
BUT NO ONE ELSE GETS THEIR OWN PRINTER
I CAN'T REMEMBER WHO ELSE
MM
MM-HMM
UM
SO WHAT I'D PROPOSE IS THAT WE SORT OF DISCUSS VARIOUS CONCEPTS WITHOUT GETTING INTO SPECIFICS
AS TO EXACTLY WHERE TO PUT PEOPLE
AND THEN GO OFF AND THINK ABOUT IT OVER LUNCH AND THEN COME BACK LATER IN THE DAY WITH SORT OF MORE SPECIFIC PROPOSALS
MM
YEAH
MM YEAH
OKAY
OH AND ON THE MAP THE LITTLE HALF CIRCULAR WELL QUATER CIRCLES ARE DOORS WHICH I'M ASSUMING YOU'VE FIGURED OUT BUT JUST IN CASE
YEAH
AND THERE'S JUST THE ONE ROOM THAT ACTUALLY HAS TWO DOORS GOING INTO IT THE THE THREE PERSON ROOM ON THE RIGHT
DOES THAT WORK
MM-HMM OKAY
'KAY SURE
YEAH
THE THREE PERSON ROOM
AND DO WE NEED A ROOM LIKE A READING ROOM OR YEAH
ROOMS YEAH
YES YEAH
A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE SAYING THAT THEY WANTED TO HAVE A READING ROOM
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE NOTICED BUT TWO OF US ARE ONLY HERE HALF THE TIME
SO MARTIN AND DAVID UM ARE HALF THE TIME AT THE E. P. F. L. AND HALF THE TIME IN GENEVA
SO WE SHOULD LEAVE A SPACE FOR THAT
AND WE CAN BECAUSE LIKE I SAID MAXIMUM EIGHTEEN PEOPLE IN THOSE ROOMS AND THERE IS ONLY FIFTEEN OF US
SO
MM
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
MM
SORT OF KEEP THAT IN MIND I GUESS WHEN
MM
YOU ARE DOING THE ACTUAL PLANNING
MM
THE FIRST SPLIT WE CAN DO IS BETWEEN ADMINISTRATION AND REASEARCH UH
I MEAN IT'S COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WORK SO WE CAN DEAL WITH ADMINISTRATION AND DECIDE SOMETHING FOR ADMINISTRATION AND THEN
YEAH
FOR THE OTHER
MM-HMM
YEAH
BUT GISELLA'S REALLY THE ONLY ADMINISTRATOR
YEAH
YEAH LOT OF PHONE CALL AND STUFF LIKE THAT SO YEAH
BECAUSE I WAS THINKING UH GISELLA IS QUITE I MEAN GILE GISELLA'S WORK IS QUITE NOISY BECAUSE IT'S SECRETARY SO
YEAH
BUT AT LEAST DEAL WITH THAT PARTICULAR SITUATION AND THEN SEE WITH THE OTHER
SO YOU WON'T SHARE AN OFFICE WITH GISELLA UNLESS YOU ARE FIFTY PER CENT AND NOT THE FIFTY PER CENT GISELLA IS WORKING WHICH IS ANOTHER CONDITION
AD ADMINISTRATOR
YEAH
YEAH
AND SHE'S ALWAYS MOVING AROUND
NO
YEAH
WHICH I DON'T KNOW IF WE CAN ASSUME THAT THERE ISN'T GOING TO BE ANY OVERLAP BETWEEN THEM
YEAH MM
SO I DON'T KNOW MAYBE WE CAN DECIDE THAT GISELLA IS HAVING ONE OF THE ONE PERSON ROOM
YEAH
YEAH I W I WOULD SUGGEST THAT TOO
YEAH THAT WOULD BE
MAYBE CONVENIENT
YEAH
EITHER THAT OR MAYBE PUT HER IN A TWO PERSON ROOM WITH THE EQUIPMENT OR
MM
WITH SOMEONE
YEAH AND WITH SOMEONE WHO IS WHO IS FIFTY PRO PERCENT
LIKE WITH THE THE PHOTOCOPIER OR MAYBE NOT THE PHOTOCOPIER BUT THE PRINTER
YEAH
YEAH
BUT AT LEAST THE THING WE KNOW THAT GISELLA IS GONNA BE ALONE
YEAH YEAH
YEAH OKAY MM-HMM
OR WITH EQUIPMENT BUT
AND NOT WITH A HUNDRED PERCENT STAFF YEAH A STAFF WORKER
YEAH
HUMANLY ALONE
I MEAN GISELLA HAS THIS FUNNY UH TYPING UH THING
YEAH
OKAY SO TH THAT'S A ONE PERSON ROOM BUT WE DON'T KNOW HOW HOW BIG THEY ARE
OR IT'S HARD TO TELL
YEAH
I MEAN THE ROOMS AREN'T TINY IF YOU LOOK AT THE THIS
TYPING MACHINE
COMPUTER FAX
YEAH
SO PROBABLY SH SHE SHOULD GET THE FAX RIGHT
YEAH YEAH THAT MAKES SENSE TO PUT THE FAX IN THERE
YEAH
YES YEAH
UH
SO
AND THEN I THINK THE MAIN DISCUSSION WE SHOULD HAVE IS
UM IF WE WANT TO MAKE GROUP OF AMONG THE SAME PROJECT OR AMONG THE SAME TITLE
YEAH
OR UH YEAH PROFESSOR ASSISTENT OR UH
OR YEAH
COUPLE OF PROFESSOR AND ASSISTANT OR
OR YEAH
OR UH YEAH
THAT'S MORE A CONCEPTUAL QUESTION THAN A PRACTICAL QUESTION
YEAH
SO IF YOU SHARE AN OFFICE WITH SOMEONE WHO'S ON A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PROJECT YOU FIND OUT ABOUT THAT PROJECT
BUT YOU ALSO SORT OF INTERACT WITH OTHER PEOPLE ON A MORE REGULAR BASIS
RIGHT
SO THAT YOU ARE NOT STUCK ONLY WITH THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING ON YOUR PROJECT
WELL THE THIRD OPTION IS JUST COMPLETELY MIX EVERYONE UP WHICH SOME PEOPLE SAY IS BETTER SORT OF FOR A GROUP ENVIRONMENT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
MM
YEAH
MM
MM YEAH
MM MM
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S UH
BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE MEETINGS OR PEOPLE COME AND ASK YOU DISCUSS THINGS MAYBE
BUT STILL I FIND IT'S QUITE EASY IF YOU ARE WITH PEOPLE WHO WORK IN THE SAME PROJECT IN THE SAME ROOM
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
THAT'S THAT'S TRUE
FOR OTHER PEOPLE WHO IS NOT WORKING ON THE SAME PROJECT
YEAH BUT WE WILL HAVE THIS READING ROOM WHICH CAN BE
YEAH
CAN RESERVE IT FOR MEETINGS
'KAY UH WILL IT BE DEDICATED FOR READING AND FOR STUDYING OR CAN WE HAVE MEETINGS THERE
YEAH
BUT IF IT'S EMPTY THEN SURE YOU CAN USE IT FOR A MEETING
I THINK IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF RESERVING IT BECAUSE THERE'S OTHER ROOMS AT THE UNIVERSITY THAT YOU CAN RESERVE FOR A MEETING
BUT I THINK IF SOMEONE'S ALREADY READING IN THERE IT'S NOT FAIR TO GO AND KICK THEM OUT JUST BECAUSE YOU WANT TO HAVE A MEETING 'CAUSE
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT
MM
YEAH FOR A REAL MEETING
YOU CAN U MM-HMM
MM
YEAH
MM
THE THE PROBLEM IS IF YOU HAVE TO GO ACROSS THE BUILDING AND IT ADDS SOME OVERHEAD EVERY TIME YOU WANT TO HAVE SOME SHORT MEETING AND DISCUSS SOME ISSUES
OR MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T CALL IT READING ROOM BUT
WELL
MEETING ABOUT THE PROJECT
NO
BUT IF YOU'RE HAVING A SHORT MEETING YOU DON'T REALLY
YOU JUST KIND OF GO TO SOMEONE'S OFFICE AND GO DOWN FOR A COFFEE OR WHATEVER
MAKE AN APPOINTMENT FOR IT
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM YEAH
'CAUSE THERE'S STILL THE CAFETERIAS THAT YOU CAN USE FOR INFORMAL
THE OTHER THING WE SHOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT IS IF YOU RECEIVE STUDENT OR NOT BECAUSE
MM YEAH
YEAH
SO IT MEANS YOU GET TIME WHERE A LOT OF PEOPLE COME ALONG AND TALK AND SO IT'S MAYBE
MARIANNE AND I INTERACT A LOT WITH STUDENT AND WE HAVE RECEPTION HOURS AND STUFF LIKE THAT
YEAH
HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
AND THE OTHER MARIANNE TOO
SO THERE'S THREE OF YOU
YEAH SO MAYBE IT'S NOT REALLY NICE TO HAVE TO SHARE AN OFFICE WITH SOMEBODY LIKE US HAVING A LOT OF SOCIAL LIFE AND
PEOPLE COMING AND GOING
BECAUSE CHANCES ARE YOU ARE NOT GONNA HAVE OFFICE HOURS AT THE EXACT SAME TIME
WELL BUT THEN YOU EITHER SHARE OFFICES WITH EACH OTHER WHICH DOESN'T REALLY SOLVE THE PROBLEM
YEAH
MM
YEAH WE DON'T
SO YOU'RE STILL GOING TO HAVE
YEAH
LIKE UNLESS YOU GET INDIVIDUAL OFFICES I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S AN EASY WAY TO FIND A SOLUTION FOR THAT
MM
YEAH
I DUNNO
'CAUSE EVEN IF EACH OF YOU SHARE WITH A PROFESSOR THEN IT'S THE SAME THING FOR THE PROFESSOR
YEAH MM MM
YEP YEAH
YEAH
BUT IT IS SOMETHING TO KEEP IN MIND
SOME PEOPLE COME IN AROUND ELEVEN AND SOME PEOPLE COME IN AROUND EIGHT
UNLESS YOU END UP SHARING AN OFFICE WITH SOMEONE WHERE YOUR SCHEDULES COMPLETELY DON'T OVERLAP AND THEN YOU CAN SCHEDULE OFFICE HOURS WHEN THE OTHER PERSON ISN'T THERE
YEAH
MM
YEAH BUT THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN'T REASONABLY ASSUME LIKE THAT AND MAKE PLANS WITH THAT BECAUSE
MM
NO
I MEAN
NO BUT YOU SORT OF SEE PEOPLE'S PATTERNS
YEAH
EVEN IF IT'S NOT ALWAYS LIKE THAT I MEAN IF IT'S LIKE THAT YOU KNOW EIGHTY PER CENT OF THE TIME THEN
MM
YEAH
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT WE CAN'T MAKE ASSUMPTIONS TOO MUCH
MM-HMM
SO PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO SEE UH THE OFFICE ORGANISED BY UH BY BY RANK LIKE PROFESSORS AND STUDENTS AND
I DON'T KNOW
I THINK
WELL IT'S UP TO US HOW WE DO IT
I CAN SEE BENEFITS OF BOTH
YEAH
YEAH IT CERTAINLY IS
BUT
BECAUSE IT MAKES MUCH MORE NOISE THAT ONLY BEING TWO IN AN OFFICE
ONE POINT I CAN SAY BY EXPERIENCE IT'S REALLY HARD TO SHARE AN OFFICE WITH THREE PEOPLE
PLUS THE COMPUTERS
YEAH
SO
PLUS THE COMPUTERS
PLUS THE COM MM-HMM
AND WE ALL KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO HAVE FIVE COMPUTERS IN YOUR OFFICE
YEAH
SO WE MIGHT BE IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA TO FIRST EXCLUDE ONE OF THE THREE PERSON ROOM TO BE THE READING ROOM AND NOT TO BE NECESSARY
A WORKING ROOM
A ROOM WITH THREE PEOPLE
YEAH BUT IF THERE ARE PEOPLE COMING IN I MEAN WE HAVE THESE PEOPLE WORKING FOR UH TWO MONTHS WHO COMES IN THE SUMMERTIME OR SOMETHING
SO UH
I TH THINK WE SHOULD RESERVE A LITTLE BIT SPACE FOR THEM TOO
YEAH THAT'S A GOOD POINT BECAUSE IF WE TAKE THE THREE PERSON ROOM OUT AS A READING ROOM
IT'S QUITE BIG
THEN EVERYONE HAS AN OFFICE RIGHT
'CAUSE IT'S MAXIMUM EIGHTEEN
SO TAKE AWAY THREE SPACES AND YOU'RE DOWN TO YOUR FIFTEEN AND YOU'RE RIGHT IF WE DO HAVE A STAGIEUR WHOEVER
WHO COMES IN THEN WE HAVE NOWHERE WELL WE CAN PUT THEM IN THE READING ROOM BUT THAT KIND OF DEFEATS THE PURPOSE
OH YEAH
OH YEAH
MM
OKAY
MM
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
AND LEAVE A SPARE SPACE FOR OR
SO THE OTHER SOLUTION IS TO SAY OKAY WE USE A THREE PERSON ROOM BUT ONLY WITH TWO PERSON EACH TIME
MM-HMM
YEAH THAT'S A GOOD IDEA YEAH
FOR SOEMTHING YEAH MM
YEAH
BUT AVOIDING
HAVING THREE PERSON FULL TIME IN A SAME ROOM COULD BE A GOOD IDEA I THINK
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S YEAH CERTAINLY IS
OR AGAIN FIND PEOPLE WHO DON'T WORK THE SAME HOURS
YEAH
IT DOESN'T COMPLETELY SOLVE THE PROBLEM BUT
MM
SO FOR THE READING ROOM WE WILL HAVE A TWO PERSON ROOM
EVERYBODY AGREES ON THAT YEP
YEAH
YEAH I THINK SO
MAYBE THAT WOULD BE GOOD
OKAY
A ONE PERSON'LL BE TOO SMALL ANYWAYS
HOW ABOUT HOW ABOUT THIS ROOM
YEAH
THE ONE ON THE BOTTOM
WHICH ONE
WITH A VIEW TO THE MOUNTAINS YEAH
IT HAS THREE WINDOWS SO I THINK IT'S UH TWO
YEAH AT THE BOTTOM IN THE MIDDLE
YEAH
WITH THE MOUNTAIN
TWO
WELL WHICH W THERE'S THREE TWO PERSON ROOMS
O ONE TWO
THE THE MIDDLE ONE
THAT HAS TWO WINDOWS
YEAH IT'S
AND STILL A BIG ROOM
WHICH IS FINE
TWO
BIG BLACK STRIPE IS THE WINDOWS
NOT THE THIN ONE BETWEEN THE BIG BUT WHAT ABOUT THE D THE OTHER ONE WHICH HAS ONLY ONE WINDOWS BUT IN THE COURTYARD IT MAYBE MORE QUIET
AH OKAY
OH THE BIG OH
YEAH SO I SHOULD HAVE EXPLAINED THAT
YEAH BUT THEN YOU GET DON'T GET A LOT OF LIGHT
FOR READING
WE HAVE ELECTRICITY SO
REALLY
I HOPE
NO IT'S A QUESTION I MEAN IT IT'S QUITE NOISY OUTSIDE WITH THE STREETS AND
THAT'S
ON THE SIXTH FLOOR I DON'T KNOW
YEAH WE ARE ON THE SIXTH FLOOR
I DUNNO I LIKE THE IDEA OF LOOKING OUT OVER
YEAH IF YOU ARE IF YOU ARE READING
AND STOP READING
YEAH
ME TOO
LOTS OF SPACE
SO IT'S A RELAXING ROOM
WELL I MEAN THAT THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT RIGHT
IT'S JUST SOMEWHERE TO GET OUT OF YOUR OFFICE AND GO AND DO SOMETHING ELSE FOR A WHILE WHETHER YOU'RE READING OR JUST KIND OF STARING OFF INTO SPACE
YEAH YEAH NO OKAY
YEAH YEAH
DO SO YEAH
MM YEAH YEAH
YOU KNOW QUICK MEETINGS ALWAYS GET LONGER
YEAH AND YOU CAN LOOK OUTSIDE OF THE WINDOW IF YOU HAVE A SH QUICK MEETING THERE
IT'S EVEN BETTER
SO WHAT ABOUT ONE OF THE ROOM IN THE CORNER
SO YOU HAVE THREE WINDOWS
MM
YEAH WE COULD DO THAT
YEAH
WHY NOT
BUT YOU HAVE LESS WALL TO PUT SHELVES AND STUFF LIKE THAT
YEAH
IF YOU INTEND THE READING ROOM BEING MORE A LIBRARY OR
I MEAN WE HAVE
WE HAVE SOME SHELVES LIKE CABINET TYPE SHELVES FOR THE READING ROOM
BUT IT'S NOT REALLY INTENDED TO BE A LIBRARY
MM
YEAH
A LIBRARY DOWN DOWNSTAIRS
MM
UM BUT
AN I. T. LIBRARY
MM
SO IT BECOMES SORT OF
THE OTHER IDEA IS TO TAKE 'CAUSE RIGHT NOW WE ALL HAVE BOOKSHELVES
SO ONE IDEA MIGHT BE TO TAKE SORT OF THE BOOKS THAT AREN'T FREQUENTLY USED BY PEOPLE PUT THEM ALL INTO THAT ROOM
YEAH
MM
YEAH
KIND OF YEAH SMALL LIBRARY
A MINI LIBRARY BUT NOT LIKE A LIBRARY SYSTEM LIBRARY JUST GO AND BORROW YOUR COLLEGUES' BOOKS
NO NO SURE BUT YEAH
NO NO NO NO
MM
SO ARE WE ALL AGREE ABOUT THESE TWO PERSON ROOMS
CORNER OR NOT CORNER
WHICH ONE
I DON'T KNOW
I THINK THE MIDDLE ONE
IN THE MIDDLE YEAH
THE MIDDLE ONE
OKAY
YEAH
IT'S ALSO SORT OF M CENTRAL TO THE LAYOUT SO EVERYONE SORT OF HAS MORE OR LESS THE SAME DISTANCE TO
YEAH
MM
OKAY
IT'S NOT THAT IT MAKES THAT MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE BUT
MM-HMM
WHY NOT
UH
SO WE CAN EXCLUDE THIS ONE TO MAKE AN OFFICE
YEAH
ACTUALLY WHAT I CAN DO IS
OR MAYBE WRITE ON THE BOARD I DON'T KNOW
J JUST PUT IT UP
UM ACTUALLY THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
YEAH
SO WE HAVE THE MAP AND
YEAH
SO
THIS REALLY ISN'T TO SCALE BUT OH WELL
UM
UM SO WE'VE GOT AN OFFICE THERE
THAT'S REALLY NOT TO SCALE
IT'S ALRIGHT
OH IT'S G GOOD ENOUGH
AND THERE'S
TWO AND ONE
THREE YEAH
IS THAT ALL
YEAH YEAH MM
SO
OKAY SO THIS IS
AND THIS BECOMES THE READING ROOM RIGHT
THAT
OKAY
IS THAT A MOUNTAIN
OKAY
YES
AND THAT AN OLD TOWN
AND UH GISELLA
YEAH SHOULD WE DECIDE ALSO THE ADMINISTRATION STUFF
AND
WE THOUGHT A ONE PERSON ROOM
SURE
SO WE EXCLUDE THE N THE THING WE ARE QUITE SURE AND THEN WE DISCUSS THE
YEAH
I WAS THINKING OF MAYBE WE SHOULD ASSIGN GISELLA INTO THIS THREE PERSON OFFICE
OKAY
BECAUSE W WE WILL PROBABLY PLACE THE PRINTER NEXT TO THE MAILBOXES
THEN WE COULD HAVE GISELLA AND THE TWO FIFTY PER CENT PEOPLE SHARING THE THREE
PERSON ROOM
PERSON ROOM
THAT'S REALLY NOISY TO BE IN THE SAME OFFICE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION
WELL TH
BUT IF GISELLA WORKS FIFTY PERCENT AND THEY WORK FIFTY PERCENT
THEY'RE FIFTY PER CENT YEAH
YEAH THAT JUST IMPLY YOU EXPECT PEOPLE TO COME WHEN GISELLA IS NOT WORKING AND THAT'S NOT REALLY FAIR IF YOU
THAT'S TRUE
YEAH
WELL I MEAN IT
SO WE CAN PUT GISELLA IN THE TWO PEOPLE ROOM
WHICH IS NEAR THE MAILBOX
NO
W YEAH WE COULD
I DON'T KNOW
I MEAN I DON'T KNOW HOW NOISY SHE IS
WE COULD
IT'S UH
I IT'S JUST THE QUESTION YOU ALWAYS HAVE THE PHONE RINGING EVEN IF THE AF EVEN WHEN SHE'S NOT WORKING
BUT
JUST
OR F
DOES GISELLA HAVE HER OWN PRINTER
YEAH
YES YES SHE DOES
YEAH BUT THAT'S THAT'S A GOOD POINT FROM NIKOS TO SAY THAT SHE NEEDS TO BE N NEAR THE MAIL BOX AND THE PRINTER AND
WELL IF YOU PUT HER IN IN THIS ROOM HERE IT'S RELATIVELY CLOSE
AND THE PHOTOCOPIER AND STUFF LIKE THAT
YEAH
EXC EXCEPT THE DOOR IS NOT REALLY
CONVENIENT FOR HER YEAH
CONVENIENT
TRUE
NO BUT I THINK IF IF THE MAIN UM HOW CAN I PUT THAT THE MM
IF THE MAIN REASON TO PUT TO TO CHOOSE GISELLA'S PLACE
IS THE PROXIMITY OF THE MAILBOX IT SHOULD BE A TWO PE PEOPLE ROOM AND NOT A THREE PEOPLE ROOM
OKAY
IT'S FINE WITH ME
YEAH
OTHERWISE WE HAVE A ONE PEOPLE ROOM AND
IT'S MORE THE I. T. ADMINISTRATION THAT USES OUR MAILBOXES
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH THE PROXIMITY TO THE MAILBOX MATTERS
BECAUSE USUALLY WHEN SHE'S HERE AND SHE PICKS UP THE MAIL SHE ACTUALLY BRINGS IT TO YOUR OFFICE
YEAH
YEAH IT'S IT'S NOT THE M
YEAH
NO BUT IT'S IT'S ALSO IT'S ALSO THE PLACE OF THE PHOTOCOPIER
YEAH YEAH
AND THE PLACE WHERE WE ALL PASS KIND OF
YEAH
THAT'S TRUE
IT SHOULD BE SOME CENTRAL PLACE
BECAUSE IF WE PUT THE PHOTOCOPIER NEAR THE MAIL BOX AND IT SEEMS TO BE THE ONLY PLACE WHERE THERE IS ROOM FOR THAT
YEAH
YEAH UNLESS YOU PUT IT INTO AN OFFICE WHICH IS JUST AN ANNOYING I THINK
'CAUSE EVEN IF YOU PUT IT INTO GISELLA'S OFFICE IT'S GONNA BE
YEAH
Y
YEAH OH NO
YEAH NO IT'S TOO
AND IT'S TOO BIG AND
YEAH
OKAY WE SHOULD WRITE THIS DOWN
DO WE AGREE THAT THE THAT THE PHOTOCOPIER AND THE NETWORKED PRINTER GOES NEXT TO THE MAILBOXES
SO
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
MM
AND THEN WE CAN FOR THE MOMENT PUT GISELLA IN THIS CORNER ROOM IF YOU AGREE I DON'T KNOW
YEAH
WHAT WITH
AT THE BEGINNING WE SAID THAT WE WERE GONNA GIVE HER ONE OF THE ONE PERSON ROOMS
YEAH
BUT THIS OPTION OF PUTTING GISELLA NEAR THE PHOTOCOPIER
OKAY
YEAH
I MEAN SHE IS SHARING AN OFFICE RIGHT NOW AND I HAS ANYBODY HEARD OF ANY COMPLAINTS THAT SHE'S TOO LOUD OR
THAT'S QUITE UH I MEAN THAT'S QUITE IMPORTANT TO KEEP A SPARE ROOM IN GISELLA'S OFFICE IF WE NEED MORE STAFF BUT
I MEAN SH WE PUT SOME TRAINEE IN GISELLA'S OFFICE BECAUSE THERE IS A SPARE ROOM AND THAT'S QUITE IMP YEAH
I MEAN SHE IS NOT SHARING AN OFFICE
WELL SHE'S GO AHEAD
STAGIEURS IN THERE
AND THEY ARE NOT REALLY IN A POSITION TO COMPLAIN
YEAH
I WOULDN'T WORK IN GISELLA'S OFFICE
OKAY
I THINK IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF WORK CONDITIONS LIKE IF YOU ARE A STAGIEUR AND YOU CO ONLY COMING IN FOR TWO MONTHS
THEN YOU CAN PUT UP WITH IT BUT IF YOU'RE THERE YOU KNOW FOR THE FULL YEAR
YEAH YEAH
I IT YEAH
SO FOR EXAMPLE NOW IF UH WE RESERVE
MM YEAH
FOR EXAMPLE AND THERE IS NO ROOM IN THE CUPBOARDS FOR ANY PEOPLE EXCEPT GISELLA BECAUSE SHE GOT LOTS OF PAPER ARCHIVES AND FILES AND STUFF LIKE THAT
SO IT'S REALLY SHE NEEDS
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
MM-HMM
SHE NEEDS SPACES
OKAY
SPACE
BUT WE CAN UH RESERVE SO IF YOU RESERVE A TWO PEOPLE ROOM WE CAN PUT UH TRAINEES
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
MM
YEAH IN THERE IF THEY NEED TO GO
FURTHER ON IF THEY ARE IN THE SAME ROOM
HMM
YEAH
OKAY SO GISELLA AT THIS SOUTHWEST OFFICE
YEAH
YEAH
IN THE CORNER
I DUNNO IF THI IF THIS MAP IS A
ARE YOU SURE IT'S SOUTHWEST
SOUTH WELL SOUTHWEST IF THAT'S NORTH
SOUTH
OKAY
OKAY THE MAP IS NORTH ORIENTED
NO
NO THA WELL I'M ASSUMING THAT'S WHAT YOU MEANT RIGHT
THAT
SOUTHWEST FOR US
YEAH YEAH THAT THAT ONE YEAH
I DON'T KNOW
OKAY
BUT THAT'S SOUTHEAST ANYWAYS
THAT'S SOUTHEAST
SOUTHEAST YEAH
OH RIGHT YEAH THAT'S SOUTHEAST YEAH IT'S
ANYWAYS YEAH BUT
THIS OFFICE RIGHT
THAT'S
YEAH THIS OFFICE YEAH
OKAY
YOU KNOW BECAUSE WITH MOUNTAIN MOUNTAINS AND OLD TOWN IT'S NOT NO SORRY UNTIL BUT
BUT I JUST ASSUMED NIKOS WAS TALKING ABOUT THE ORIENTATION HERE
NO I I'M VERY BAD AT ORIENTING WHERE'S NORTH IN GENEVA I ALWAYS GET IT WRONG
UH YEAH I WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT UH HERE ON THE MAP
OKAY
NO BECAUSE SUNRISE AND SUNSHINE IS QUITE UH SUNSHINE SUNRISE AND SUNSET IS QUITE ALSO A GOOD UM
OH THAT'S TRUE
SO WAIT WE FACE THE OLD TOWN WE FACE THE OLD TOWN NOW AND WE ARE FACING
SOMETHING TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT
UH NORTHEAST
NORTH
NORTHEAST
SUNRISE
SO
OKAY
THIS IS NORTHEAST
IT'S EAST YEAH EAST
NO EAST
WE WE HAVE SUN IN THE MORNING ONLY
YEAH
WHEN DO WE HAVE SUN
SO IT DOES MEAN THAT THE THREE PIECE ROOM WHICH IS IN THE OPPOSITE OF THE NORTHEAST IS THE MOST SUNNY ONE
MM-HMM
THIS ONE
BUT S
LET'S SAY THAT
THE THREE PEOPLE ROOM OR
IT'S IT'S THE ONE YOU HAVE OF NOW YOU BOTH
IT'S THE OVEN
MORE OR LESS
WELL THERE IS A QUITE A LOT OF SUN
AND IT'S REALLY WARM AND
YOU GET THE SUNSET THEN
NO
IT'S YEAH IT'S REALLY WARM THAT'S
Y YES AND NO
YOU GET LOTS OF SUN DURING SUMMER YES
DO YOU UH BY THE WAY IS IT A SIX FLOOR BUILDING OR IS THERE MORE
YEAH YEAH THAT'S TRUE
YEAH WE'RE THE TOP FLOOR
OKAY
SO IT'S WARM
YEAH
IT THE BUILDING DESIGN IS PRETTY MUCH THE SAME AS THE ONE WE HAVE NOW WE'RE JUST GETTING MORE SPACE THIS WAY
BECAUSE WE COULDN'T MOVE IN THE OTHER BUILDING 'CAUSE IT WAS OCCUPIED BY THE OTHER DEPARTMENTS
MM
OKAY
MM-HMM
OKAY
MM
OKAY GOOD P SO
SO HOW MANY ROOMS
AND NEXT
AND UH HOW MANY PLACE DO WE HAVE
SO WE HAVE RESERVED NOW TWO TWO PERSON ROOMS
ACTUALLY WHY DON'T I CHANGE IT ON HERE AS WELL
SO THAT'S GISELLA
YEAH PLUS ONE SPARE PLACE BUT REALLY THE LAST PLACE TO BE USED
PLUS SPARE YEAH
PLUS FAX
YEAH
MM-HMM
AND THEN THIS IS THE READING ROOM
OKAY
OOPS
UM
SO THAT LEAVES US WITH WHAT
SIX EIGHT FOURTEEN PLACES WHICH IS
WE GOT TWO THREE FOUR SIX NINE
WE GOT
FOURTEEN PLACES
FOR FOURTEEN PEOPLE
NO FOR FOURTEEN 'CAUSE GISELLA'S ALREADY GOT A ROOM
FOR F YEAH
FOR FOURTEEN PEOPLE
FOR FIFTEEN PEOPLE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
SO WE ARE GOOD
T OKAY
EXCUSE ME
OKAY
UM
BLESS YOU
SO
SO I'M GONNA TAKE GISELLA OFF OF
I'LL PUT HER IN GREY I GUESS
THAT LIST AS WELL
I TO MARIANNE
CAN WE GROUP PEOPLE BY THEIR NAME
SO IT'S GONNA BE MARIANNES' OFFICE
MARIANNE MARIANNE
YEAH WHY NOT
ALPHABETICALLY
YEAH THAT WOULD BE FUN
IS IS ANY IS THERE ANYBODY WHO'S NOT HAPPY WITH THE CURRENT SITUATION SO WE COULD TRY TO JUST KEEP THE SAME ARRANGEMENT JUST ON THE NEW BUILDING
BECAUSE THERE IS NO WE CAN'T BECAUSE NO WE CAN'T THERE IS TWO
THAT'S BORING BUT THAT CAN BE A GOOD IDEA BUT DO DO WE CAN WE DO THAT
YEAH THAT'S GOING THAT CAN BE
THAT'S BORING
THAT'S BORING
CAN WE
NO
NO WE DON'T
WE HAVE WE HAVE ONE EXTRA ONE PERSON OFFICE AND
AND TWO THREE PERSON ROOM
TWO THREE PERSON OFFICES YEAH
PLUS WE HAVE THE TWO PEOPLE WHO AREN'T THERE NOW
YEAH
SO
THAT WE HAVE TO PUT SOMEWHERE
WE CAN KEEP SOME OF THE PEOPLE TOGETHER THAT ARE TOGETHER NOW BUT
MM
YEAH YEAH
NOT EVERYONE DEFINITELY
OKAY
SO LET'S START THEN TOP TO BOTTOM MAGGIE
WELL WHY DON'T WE TAKE A BREAK AND GO OFF AND THINK ABOUT IT
SUSAN
YEAH
'CAUSE IF WE JUST SIT HERE AND DISCUSS IT'S GONNA TAKE A LONG TIME AND WE'RE GONNA START ARGUING AND GET CRANKY AND
AND THEN ONCE WE HAVE MORE CONCRETE IDEAS WE CAN COME BACK AND FINISH IT
I THINK WE CLEAR THE THINGS A LITTLE BIT UP TOO S YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
OKAY
SAVE YOUR FILE
SO LET'S HAVE A BREAK
ALRIGHT SO
YEAH
YOU HAVE X. P.
YEP
THAT'S NICE
MM-HMM
OKAY
SO HOW LONG IS
SO NOW THAT WE'VE ALL HAD A BIT OF TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT UM DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY CONCRETE PROPOSALS OR DO WE WANT TO JUST
OKAY
GO THROUGH PEOPLE AND START PLACING THEM AND KIND OF DISCUSS AS WE GO ALONG
I DON'T THINK THEY ARE CONCRETE PROPOSALS
NOPE
NO
NOT REALLY
LIKE I DON'T KNOW CHOOSE ONE PARAMETER
NO IT'S KIND OF WE SHOULD MAYBE FIND A METHOD TO DO STUFF
LIKE I DUNNO MAYBE PERMANENT STAFF AND NON PERMANENT STAFF WE KNOW THAT PROFESSOR WILL STAY FOR A LONG TIME
THE FIRST PARAMETER TO CHOOSE PEOPLE TO CHOOSE WHERE TO PUT PEOPLE
WE UH WE DON'T KNOW FOR THE OTHER
OKAY
YEAH
SO
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
MAYBE THAT COULD BE THE FIRST PARAMETER TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT
NOT JUST TO HAVE THIS DIS
YEAH GIVE THEM LIKE THE MOST COMFORTABLE OFFICES AND
YEAH
YEAH AND HAVE THIS DISCUSSION EVERY TWO YEARS
YEAH
BECAUSE IT'S
YOU KNOW
YEAH THIS MAKES SENSE
YEAH
MAKE SENSE FOR EVERYONE
YEAH YEAH
AND YEAH
SO WE CAN CHOOSE WHERE TO PUT UH I WOULD SAY THE THE THE THREE FIRST ONE OF THE LIST
YEAH YEAH
SUZANNE FOR EXAMPLE
MM-HMM
'CAUSE A PROFESSOR BUT HE'S ONLY HERE HALF TIME SO IT'S SORT OF A DIFFERENT SITUATION
AND HE'S A PROFESSOR AT BUT NOT IN GENEVA HE JUST DOES RESEARCH IN GENEVA
MM AND MAYBE THE TWO OTHER SENIOR ANDREI AND NANCY
YEAH
OKAY SO LET'S
AND THEN YEAH
GO THROUGH THAT FIRST
UM
MM
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK FOR UH
SUSAN AND MAGGIE FOR EXAMPLE THE
THE ROOMS FOR ONE PERSON
YEAH THAT COULD BE AN IDEA
AND FOR SUSAN PROBABLY YEAH 'CAUSE I THINK SHE PREFERS TO HAVE HER OWN OFFICE
YEAH
MM
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
UM
ANY PREFERENCES TO WHICH ONE
NATURALLY
'KAY
I PUT SUSAN HERE FOR NOW
CAN SWITCH
AND THEN MAGGIE IN THE OTHER ONE
YEAH
YEAH
IT'S UP TO THEM I GUESS UH
NO IT'S UP TO US
THEY'RE NOT HERE SO
UP TO US
THEY CAN SWITCH LATER
WELL I MEAN THEY THEY CAN SWITCH LATER
YEAH TO
WHICH IS
UM OKAY
AND THEN
PIRETTE NEXT
SO WE NEED TO PUT PIRETTE
ANDREI AND NANCY DO WE WANT TO THE THE QUESTION IS NOW IS DO WE WANT TO PUT THE THREE TOGETHER OR THE THREE COMPLETELY SEPARATE
YEP
WITH
OTHER PEOPLE
I WOULD SAY NOT TOGETHER IN A THREE IT'S QUITE A LO YEAH YEAH
UM
S HE TEACHES BUT OKAY
WELL PIERRETTE HAS STUDENTS AND ANDREI AND DON'T
WELL DOES ANDREI
YEAH YEAH
SOME SOME
YEAH BUT FEW LESS THAN PIERRETTE
SOME
JUST YEAH
YEAH
SO WE HAVE A
'CAUSE ALSO IF WE'RE GONNA PUT PEOPLE TOGETHER BY PROJECTS THEN THERE'S NO SENSE TO PUT THEM TOGETHER 'CAUSE THEY ALL WORK ON DIFFERENT PROJECTS
MM
RIGHT
YEAH
UM I JUST REALISED SOMETHING
THE TWO PEOPLE ROOM IN THE MIDDLE WHICH HAS ONLY ONE WINDOWS
MM
YEAH
IT'S GONNA BE PRETTY HARD TO PUT TWO PEOPLE INSIDE THAT ROOM
'CAUSE THEY'LL FIGHT FOR THE WINDOW
YEAH
YEAH IT'S QUITE DARK
WHAT ABOUT MOVING GISELLA IN THERE
IF SHE'S IN THERE HALF THE TIME SHE CAN HAVE HER DESK NEAR THE WINDOW AND OKAY SHE'S NOT NEAR THE MAILBOX BUT
YEAH
EXCEPT WE YEAH
AND NEAR THE PHOTOCOPIER
BUT IT MAYBE MORE SORT OF PRACTICAL IN TERMS OF WORKING ENVIRONMENTS FOR PEOPLE
YEAH
YEAH IT WOULD BE NICER
AND WHAT ABOUT THE READING ROOM
WHO
BUT AGAIN ONE OF THE REASONS FOR PUTTING THE READING ROOM WHERE IT IS IS SO THAT YOU HAVE
SO WE MIGHT THINK THAT IT'S BETTER TO HAVE A MORE COMFORTABLE OFFICE THAN A MORE COMFORTABLE READING ROOM I DON'T KNOW
IT CHANGE THE PLAN OF THE MORNING I'M SORRY BUT I JUST REALISED THAT STUPID ARCHITECT PUT ONLY ONE WINDOWS
YEAH BUT YOU I MEAN UH I THINK EVERYBODY IS SUPPOSED TO SPEND MORE TIME IN THEIR OFFICE THAN IN THE READING ROOM
YOU THINK
FINALLY YOU THINK
YEAH I AGREE IT'S UH
YEAH
WHO BUILT THIS BUILDING
DO WE KNOW THAT
I DON'T KNOW
I DUNNO
WHAT DO YOU THINK
SO I DON'T KNOW WE SPENT QUITE SOME TIME AT THE LAST MEETING AND T TO DECIDE THIS AND NOW WE ARE JUST
YEAH
YEAH I KNOW BUT IN THE LAST MEETING NOBODY JUST
AND I THINK IT IS ONE PROBLEM
TOOK ATTENTION AT THIS ONE WINDOWS PROBLEM
YEAH M
SO I DON'T THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA
OF COURSE BUT EVERYBODY HAD THE DOCUMENTS BEFORE SO YOU COULD HAVE STUDIED THEM
OR WHAT IF YOU PUT
YEAH YOU TOO I CAN I CAN SAY THE THING TO YOU I'M SORRY
YOU YOU SAID THAT THERE IS ELECTRICITY
WHAT IF WE PUT THE TWO PEOPLE THAT ARE FIFTY PER CENT IN THAT ROOM
YEAH
IN THE
THAT'S REALLY WELCOMING AND WARMING
THE TWO PEOPLE
BUT THEY ARE ONLY HERE FIFTY PER CENT
YEAH
WELL LET'S UH HOW WE CAN UH FILL THE THREE PERSON ROOMS
SAY IT AGAIN
WHAT WHAT WHAT
I MEAN WE HAVE NOW A TWO THREE PERSON ROOMS LEFT
UH HOW WE GE WHO WE GONNA PUT IN THE THREE PERSON ROOMS
AND UM
YEAH
AND UH I JUST NOTICED THAT WE HAVE THIS TWO PEOPLE ROOM
NO NO BUT THE MAIN PROBLEM WE HAVE THE SAME NUMBER OF PLACE AND THE SAME NUMBER OF PEOPLE NOW
MM WE DO
YEAH YEAH
MM
SO EVERYONE HAS TO GO SOMEWHERE
W I I I DON'T MIND GOING INTO THIS OFFICE
AND YOU ALSO HAVE ONE THREE PERSON ROOM WITH TWO WINDOWS
YOU HAVE TO FIND SOMEBODY AGREE TO COME WITH YOU
YOU DON'T MIND TO HAVE OKAY SO NIKOS AND YOU HAVE TO FIND YEAH
WITH ONLY ONE WINDOWS
YEAH
AND IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF YOU IT'S A QUESTION OF WINDOWS
NIKOS VOLUNTEERS
NO
WHO YOU'RE TAKING WITH YOU
WHO WOULD YOU PUT WITH YOU
LET'S PUT A FIFTY PER CENT SO
OH WHY NOT
WELL 'KAY SO LET'S PUT DAVID IN THERE YEAH
OKAY
YOU WILL LEARN TO KNOW HIM
FROM THE DAVID
YEAH
DO YOU KNOW DAVID
YEAH
NO
OKAY
YOU'LL MEET HIM
SO I'M JUST GONNA
MAKE A LIST ON HERE OF WHO WE HAVE
KEEP TALKING
SO DAVID AND NIKOS IT'S DONE
AND WITH UM PIRETTE UH
UH PIERRETTE UH ANDREI NANCY
SO WHERE WERE WE
ANDREI AND NANCY
MAYBE WE CAN PUT PIERRETTE AND HER T TWO TWO P. H. D. STUDENTS INTO ONE ROOM
YEAH WHY NOT
HOW MANY P. H. D. STUDENT DOES SHE HAVE
ALL TWO MARIANNES OR
AND ME
AND YOU TOO OKAY
SO WE NEED A
UM

OFFICIALLY

WITH PIERRETTE
OKAY SO DAVID NIKOS GISELLA MAGGIE AND SUSAN ARE DONE
OKAY
SO AND CAN YOU PUT THE THE MAP AGAIN SO WE S SEE WHAT HAPPEN
YEAH

YALINA YA YALINA WOULD BE GOOD
OKAY
WITH BEAUTIFUL LAUGHTER
YEAH
YALINA
OKAY
AND WE HAVE UH
NOW
DO YOU THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO PUT MARTIN AND ANDREI TOGETHER SINCE THEY ARE WORKING ON THE SAME PROJECT
THAT COULD WORK
YEAH
AND ANYWAY MARTIN IS JUST A FIFTY PER CENT
YEAH
AND WE MIGHT PUT MARTIN AND ANDREI AND SOMEONE ELSE IN THE THREE PERSON ROOM SINCE THE FIFTY PER CENT IT'S A GOOD
IN ROOM YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
MM
I GUESS I CAN GO IN THERE 'CAUSE MARTIN AND I WOR ARE WORKING ON THE SORT OF THE SAME THING
OKAY
OKAY
AND THAT LEAVES
MARIA AND NANCY
AND NANCY
THAT'S REALLY STRANGE
THAT'S ALL
YEAH THAT'S A WEIRD COMBINATION
WHY
SO WHAT DO WE THINK ABOUT THAT
HOW I HOW IT LOOKS LIKE
OKAY W W WHY DON'T WE MOVE MARIA TO THIS TO WHERE TO THE OFFICE I'M SUPPOSED TO BE AND I CAN GO WITH NANCY
IT'S JUST YOU'VE ALMOST GOT LIKE A PROJECT SPLIT
NO IT'S NOT THAT
IF YOU THINK THAT
EXCEPT THAT YOU DON'T BECAUSE
NANCY AND MAGGIE AND I WORK ON PREMINDIA PARMENIDY PARMENIDIES
AND THEN ANDREI MARTIN MARIA AND I ALSO WORK ON
MM-HMM MM YEAH
ALTHOUGH THE SUSAN AND MAGGIE THING WE CAN'T REALLY CHANGE
AND SORT OF SUSAN
I THINK THIS PROJECT THING IS NOT GOOD THING
THIS PROJECT SPLITTING I MEAN
NO
SPLITTING BY PROJECT
BUT THEN WE SHOULD SPLIT THE LITTLE PARTY UP
YEAH
NO BUT IF YOU IF IF YOU SPLIT BY PROJECT YOU PUT ME IN ONE PERSON ROOM
YEAH YOU CAN
ALL ON YOUR OWN
AH
HMM
THAT'S HARD
I WOULD PUT THE ROOM WITH MARTIN IN IT IN THE TWO WINDOW ROOM 'CAUSE HE'S FIFTY PER CENT SO THEN AT LEAST
SEE I WOULD PUT IT THE OTHER WAY
THE OTHER TWO PEOPLE GET
COULD YOU SAY THAT AGAIN
PUT MARTIN IN THE THREE PERSON ROOM WITH TWO WINDOWS
OKAY
SINCE HE'S FIFTY PER CENT
OKAY
SO YOU JUST
YOU JUST MOVE HIM OR
THE TWO GROUPS
YOU JUST
WELL I DON'T KNOW FOR SPLITTING UP
EITHER WAY
BUT IS THIS ABOUT WINDOWS OR IS IT ABOUT IT IT IT MUST BE FUNCTIONAL
IF YOU AND MARTIN WORK ON THE SAME PROJECT THEN
PEOPLE OR
YEAH UH THAT WAS MY QUESTION
YEAH
I MEAN IS IT IMPORTANT TO HAVE SOMEONE UH FROM THE SAME PROJECT OR UM
YEAH I MEAN WITH WHOM YOU'D YOU'D TO WITH WHOM YOU'D LIKE TO WORK IN THE SAME OFFICE
WELL I'M TRYING TO OPTIMISE
I DON'T THINK IT'S NECESSARILY SO IMPORTANT TO BE IN THE SAME OFFICE WITH SOMEONE
NO
IF YOU'RE WORKING ON THE SAME PROJECT
YEAH WE CAN EACH OTHER YEAH
YEAH WE CAN SKIVE
BUT YOU'RE GONNA DISTURB ALL THE PEOPLE
'CAUSE YOU'RE TOO LAZY TO GET UP AND WALK NEXT DOOR
WE'RE GONNA DISTURB ALL THE PEOPLE BY SKIVING ALL THE TIME
WE DON'T WORK ON ANY PROJECTS TOGETHER
I DON'T KNOW LIKE RIGHT NOW I SHARE AN OFFICE WITH BRUNO
EXCEPT COFFEE TIME AND THAT'S IMPORTANT PROJECT TOO BUT UH GOSSIPING AND STUFF LIKE THAT YES
MM
YEAH
OF COURSE
LIKE I DON'T NEED TO BE IN THE SAME OFFICE WITH SOMEONE WHO WORKS ON OR
BUT I MEAN THAT'S FINE
YEAH
SOMEONE WHO WORKS ON PARMENIDIES
IT'S NOT LIKE YEAH
AND IT'S QUITE FUNNY TO TO TO HEAR OTHER
AND NOT ALWAYS THE SAME STUFF
ACTIVITIES AROUND YOU
YEAH THAT'S FOR SURE
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S ACTIVITY THAT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND OR YEAH
KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT YEAH
WHAT
YOU HEAR THINGS OUT OF CONTEXT
SO BRUNO IS NOT ON AND HE'S SHARING UM OFFICE
I AGREE BUT THE SETUP IS PRETTY GOOD NOW
UH I'M NOT SHARING SOMEBODY WITH I WORK ON THE SAME PROJECT
WITH

OKAY
NO THAT'S QUITE NICE
UH UM YEAH
I DUNNO YOU WERE SAYING THAT UH MARIA AND NANCY DOESN'T FIT TOGETHER IN THE SAME
YEAH I YEAH
I JUST CAN'T REALLY SEE THEM SHARING AN OFFICE I DON'T KNOW WHY
SO WHAT YOU SAY IF YOU CHANGE THE OFFICE UH I DON'T KNOW AND YOU WORK WITH NANCY OR UH
WHAT DO YOU YEAH I DUNNO
OR WE PUT ANDREI AND NANCY TO NANCY TOGETHER 'CAUSE THEY'RE STARTING THAT NEW
AND THEN PUT MARIA WITH
PROJECT
OH YEAH
FOR EXAMPLE
MARTIN AND YOU YEAH
I CAN SEE THAT WORKING A BIT BETTER
ME AND MARTHA
YEAH OKAY WHY NOT
YEAH
YEAH
SOUNDS OKAY
HMM
WHAT DO YOU SAY
I'M NOT TOTALLY CONVINCED
SORRY
I'M NOT CONVINCED ABOUT THIS
I DUNNO
NO WHAT'S BOTHERING YOU
YEAH WHAT IS IT NOW
I THI I THINK
I THOUGHT YOU WERE SAYING YOU DIDN'T WANNA BE IN A THREE PERSON ROOM
FIRST OF ALL
YEAH
FIRST OF ALL NO FROM THE BEGINNING I SAID THE THREE PERSON ROOM IT'S QUITE I MEAN IT'S A DISADVANTAGE
AND NOW YOU ARE YOU ARE CHANGING YOUR MIND ALL THE TIME
BU S SOMEBODY HAS TO BE
YEAH BUT IF YOU WORK WITH THE PEOPLE LIKE PIRETTE AND MARIANNE UH
AND UM
TO CHANGE A LITTLE BIT THIS DISADVANTAGE WE PUT SOMEBODY FIFTY PER CENT IN
AND PUT DAVID BUT THEN YOU AND NIKOS HAVE THE WINDOW PROBLEM WHICH IS WHY I STILL THINK WE SHOULD PUT GISELLA IN THAT ROOM BECAUSE
YEAH
THREE PERSON ROOM SO WE COULD DO THE SAME IN THE THREE PERSON ROOMS BUT THERE IS STILL THIS PROBLEM YEAH
YEAH
IT'S
WELL AT MM
NOT FOR ENJOYING THE VIEW
YEAH
SHE GETS THE WINDOW THE WHATEVER HE'S THERE FOR TWO MONTHS IT'S THEIR PROBLEM
YEAH IT'S HERE FOR WORKING
NOT NOT US BUT EXACTLY
UH WELL
SO
AND YOU SO THERE IS NO VIEW
PIRETTE IS HAVING QUITE A
SO IT'S GONNA BE A QUI YEAH SO IT'S QUITE A
UNADVANTAGED SITUATION BECAUSE THERE ARE MARIANNE AND BRUNO WHO ARE HAVING UH RECEPTION HOURS
YEAH BUT IF YOU PUT
AND PIRETTE AS WELL
WE UH ALL HAVE UH RECEPTION HOURS
TRAFFIC THERE I WOULD SAY
YEAH
SO WHAT IF WE
SWITCH NO
I MEAN IF THERE ARE RECEPTION HOURS SO SOMEBODY COULD MOVE TO THE READING ROOM AND HAVE PEOPLE
WELL WILL THERE BE WIRELESS IN THE BUILDING
YEAH
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A COMPUTER WITH WIRELESS
WELL ISN'T THIS THE CASE
NO
DOESN'T EVERYBODY HAS ONE
PICK UP YOUR DESKTOP AND PLUS YOU CAN'T ASSUME THAT YOU CAN JUST USE THE READING ROOM FOR RECEPTION HOURS
NO
WELL MOST OF US FIRST OF ALL HAVE DESKTOP COMPUTERS
NO
SO WELL OF COURSE IF THEY PUT UH
YOU CAN MOVE WITH YOUR DESKTOP YEAH
NO
RIGHT
LIKE IF PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY USING IT AS A READING ROOM
THE AIM HAVING A ROOM ROOM FOR READING OR
YEAH
YEAH
CAN WE SAY WE'RE GONNA MOVE GISELLA HERE
YEAH OKAY
YEAH
AND THEN
GOES HERE
I THINK THAT GIVES US A LITTLE BIT MORE FLEXIBILITY TO PLAY WITH MOVING PEOPLE AROUND
YEAH
INSTEAD OF
OKAY CAN WE SAY THAT DAVID UH IS YEAH
YOU WERE THE FIRST ONE ON THE LIST BUT IF YOU WANNA REMOVE SOMEONE ELSE
OKAY BUT OKAY
NO BECAUSE I WAS THINKING OF WE CAN UM
HAVING THESE TWO OFFICE WHICH ARE NEAR TO THE LIFT
KEEP THIS OFFICE FOR RECEPTION PEOPLE
IF I CAN CON WE ARE PIRETTE THE TWO MARIANNE AND I ARE RECEIVI AND MAGGIE AND SUSAN ARE RECEIVING A LOT OF STUDENT
SO WE
PEOPLE
YEAH
SO WHAT IF WE PUT YOU WITH YEAH
OKAY SO
WILL YOU HAVE
MM-HMM
WITH THE FINNISH FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU WANT ME
YES I WILL
WELL YOU CAN YOU ALS ALREADY SPEAK QUITE WELL FINNISH SO WE MIGHT GET ALONG YEAH
YEAH SO THAT'S KI YEAH YEAH OKAY
LOPETA
I'M JUST PUTTING YALINA IN SO WE DON'T
UH THAT'S NICE TO HAVE A CORNER A STUDENT I MEAN A STUDENT AREA
YEAH YEAH
IT'S EASY FOR THEM TO
YEAH TO FIND US AND IT'S ALSO QUITE NOISY WHEN YOU HAVE THIS KIND OF
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
YEAH
FIND THE PEOPLE
MM-HMM
PARADE OF STUDENT BEFORE THE EXAMS
SO IF YOU WORK WITH ME AND YOU HAVE THIS
YEAH
MM
MM-HMM
IT ONLY GOES ON YALINA
NO
I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THAT
HMM
AGREE WITH THAT
OR DO YOU WANNA GO SOMEWHERE ELSE
UM
SO AND THE PHOTOCOPIER IS STILL
HERE
YEAH
YEAH WE HAVE TO FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE
BUT WELL
YOU JUST DON'T PHOTOCOPY
YEAH
YEAH WHO DOES ANYWAY
YEAH THE PEOPLE HAVING STUDENTS
YEAH
SO MAYBE YOU AND BRUNO SHOULD TAKE THIS OFFICE

WELL YOU HAVE THE OTHER
YEAH
LIFT
OKAY
YEAH IF WE CHANGE THE
THE SWITCH
THREE PEOPLE
PIRETTE MARIANNE DAVID DAVID
WITH HERE

YEAH
YEAH THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
AND THEN YEAH
THAT'S QUITE GOOD
SO LIKE THAT AND THEN MOVE YOU TO
WITH VIEW EVERYWHERE
AHA

THAT'S WHAT THE PLAN WAS
FROM THE BEGINNING
W WITH THE MOUNT AH MY MOUNTAINS YES I GOT THE MOUNTAINS

DO YOU GET THE PHOTOCOPYING NOISE
NOW WE ARE ALL GONNA COME PHOTOCOPY JUST TO ANNOY YOU
WE CLOSE THE DOOR
AND IT'S NOT VERY HEALTHY EITHER YEAH
AND BATHROOMS ARE NEARBY YEAH
YEAH AND
OKAY
I THINK THAT'S QUITE NICE
OR DID WAS THE ID
I SHOULD START START MAKING FULL SENTENCES
WHAT ABOUT
I WAS THINKING ABOUT MOVING PIERRETTE AND MARIANNE INTO A TWO PERSON OFFICE RATHER THAN A THREE PERSON OFFICE
AND PUT DAVID
AND THEN
BUT
WITH ANDREI AND NANCY FOR EXAMPLE
AND WHY
IN A TWO PERSON OFFICE
BECAUSE IF THEY HAVE RECEPTION
NO IN A THREE PERSON OFFICE
I KNOW I THOUGHT YOU WERE SAYING THAT
PIERRETTE SHOULD HAVE A SMALLER OFFICE
OR BE IN A SMALLER OFFICE BECAUSE OF RECEPTION OR SOMETHING OR DID I JUST COMPLETELY MISUNDERSTAND
NO NO THE REASON TO PUT PIRETTE AND MARIANNE MARIANNE AND I TOGETHER IS BECAUSE OF THE NOISE WE MAKE BY RECEIVING STUDENTS
OKAY
AND THEN THE REASON TO PUT DAVID IN THIS OFFICE IT'S BECAUSE YEAH IT'S FIFTY PER CENT IN A THREE
IS BECAUSE HE'S FIFTY PER CENT OKAY
FIFTY PER CENT YEAH
OKAY THAT WORKS
UM
PLACE OFFICE
UM
THAT SOUNDS NICE NO
YEAH LOOKS GOOD
MM-HMM

YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
MM
SO IT IS SORT OF A WELL NO IT'S NOT A PROJECT SPLIT
IS
IT'S WEIRD 'CAUSE IT KIND OF IS AND KIND OF ISN'T
BECAUSE MARIA AND MARTIN AND I WORK ALL WORK ON THE SAME PROJECT AND THEN ANDREI AND NANCY WORK ON THE SAME PROJECT AND PIERRETTE N YEAH

GOOD WE'RE DONE THEN
OKAY
AND DON'T FORGET THE
OH YEAH
UM SO HI EVERYONE
SO THAT'S A VERY GOOD PIECE OF NEWS
THANKS FOR COMING TO THIS MEETING
UM WELL AS YOU ALL KNOW THE TOPIC OF THIS MORNING'S MEETING IS UH THE FACT THAT WE'RE MOVING AND WE ARE GOING TO GET MORE SPACE
UH BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO FIND OUT HOW WE USE THIS SPACE
SO UM IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE THE DOCUMENTS UH LET ME JUST UH SHOW YOU VERY BRIEFLY THE THE CONFIGURATION OF THE THE SPACE
SO UM IF YOU WANT I'LL JUST GIVE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF WHAT'S HAPPENING AND THEN WE CAN UH TALK ABOUT
WELL ARRANGING THESE NEW UH THE NEW OFFICE SPACE
UH AND A COURTYARD WHICH ACTUALLY MEANS A SORT OF UH SHAFT BECAUSE UH THE COURT IS UH DOWN AT UH THE FIRST FLOOR
SO WE HAVE THE OLD TOWN ON ONE SIDE AND THE MOUNTAINS ON THE OTHER TWO SIDES
UM ACTUALLY I THINK AGNES DID THIS NICE DRAWING SO SHE EVEN PUT THE THE VIEW
AS YOU CAN SEE WE HAVE SEVERAL CORRIDOR UM WITH A NUMBER OF UH OF UH OF ROOMS
UH THAT'S WHY ACTUALLY THE UNIVERSITY FINALLY UM ALLOCATED US THIS UH THIS PART OF UH THE UNIMAIL BUILDING
AND IT'S UH SORT OF CONTIGUOUS ROOMS AS YOU YOU CAN ALL SEE FROM UH FROM HERE
SO IT'S AT THE SIXTH FLOOR
UH WE HAVE SOME BATHROOMS FOR US
UM SO THE THE THE ONE P. TWO P. THREE P. MEANS THE THE NUMBER OF PERSONS
OF ONE PERSON ROOMS TWO PERSON ROOM AND AND THREE PERSON ROOMS
SO UM WELL THERE IS NOTHING MUCH TO SAY
WELL YOU KNOW HOW MANY OF US ARE ARE PRESENT AND YOU KNOW THAT WE ARE UM A BIT TIGHT ACTUALLY IN OUR PRESENT LOCATION
I MEAN IF THERE ARE TWO PEOPLE IS IT REALLY THAT YOU CAN'T PUT THREE OR UH TWO AND A HALF OR UH HOW HOW WAS IT CALCULATED
ANDRE JUST YEAH JUST A A CLARIFICATION QUESTION ARE THEY NUMBER OF PEOPLE PER ROOM INDICATED STRICT OR CAN WE PLAY AROUND WITH
I THINK UH PERSONS OH ACTUALLY EIGHTEEN PERSONS IN THE OFFICES
SO I'M NOT REALLY SURE IT'S POSSIBLE TO GET THREE UM THREE DESKS IN A TWO PERSON OFFICE
BUT UM WE COULD TRY
SO IN FACT THERE ARE MORE PLACES THAN PEOPLE SO WE WON'T BE THAT CONSTRAINED
WELL IT'S A BIT DIFFICULT TO SAY BECAUSE UM IN FACT WE HAVE SOME CONSTRAINTS IN TERMS OF FURNITURE
WITH OF COURSE A CHAIR
UM I CAN KEEP THIS FOR YOU
YOU TOO DAVID I THINK
SO EACH PERSON SHOULD GET UM WELL IT'S A SORT OF DESK IT'S MADE OF TWO PIECES AND IT LOOKS LIKE A CORNER
DO YOU NEED SOMETHING MARTIN
NORMALLY WE SHOULD EVEN GET AN EXTRA UH AN EXTRA PLACE FOR YOU KNOW TEMPORARY PEOPLE COMING TO WORK ON UH ON PROJECTS
UH AS YOU KNOW SOME OF US AND SOME OF YOU HERE ACTUALLY MARTIN AND DAVID ARE PART TIME
WHAT'S WHAT SHOULD BE SAID HERE I DON'T KNOW IF WELL YOU I I WILL MAYBE DISTRIBUTE NOW DOCUMENTS IF YOU DON'T HAVE THEM
SO IT IT'S FOR THE MOMENT QUITE COMFORTABLE
UH YEAH I UH YEAH I COUNTED SO WE HAVE UM FIFTEEN PERS PHYSICAL PERSONS AND ABOUT UH SIXTEEN
UH SO IT'S IT'S YEAH YOU HAVE A COPY SUSAN
UH A FILING CABINET THAT GOES UNDER THE DESK UH AND WELL WE CAN PUT HANGING SHELVES OVER THE THE DESKS
MAYBE IT'S EASIER
UH THEY ARE HERE
SO UM WELL YOUR YOUR PERSON YOUR YOUR QUESTION ACTUALLY IS ANSWERED MAYBE BY THE THIRD ITEM
'KAY
MM-HMM
I HAVE EVERYTHING
OKAY SO
I HAVE A COPY
YEAH
MM-HMM
ARE YOU SURE OF THAT
MM-HMM
TWO
SIX SEVEN EIGHT NINE TEN ELEVEN TWELVE THIRTEEN FOURTEEN FIFTEEN SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN
YEAH BUT COUNTING THE REA THE THE READING ROOM
SO IN ONE OF THE ROOMS
EXACTLY IT SO ONE OF THE ISSUES UH HERE IT'S PROBABLY NOT ON THE SLIDES IS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE UH
UNLIKE WHAT HAD UNTIL NOW A LOUNGE OR READING ROOM UH IN ONE OF THE THE OFFICES
MM-HMM
DO WE REALLY NEED THAT
UM I THINK QUITE A LOT OF PEOPLE E EXPRESSED THE NEED FOR THAT
SO IF WE COULD DO IT THEN I THINK IT WOULD BE MUCH NICER
UM LET ME ALSO UH ST SAY SOMETHING YEP
AND SUSAN DON'T FORGET THE TIME WE SPEND TO FOR DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THAT ROOM SO YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO VALORIZE THIS IF POSSIBLE
OKAY
YEAH I I THINK SO
UH BECAUSE FIFTEEN PEOPLE TO PUT IN THERE EIGHTEEN POSITIONS
BUT I STILL AGREE WITH YOU THAT THE B THE WE ARE NOT SO WE ARE NOT SO LARGE AS FAR AS SPACE IS CONCERNED
MM
SO UH TO THE BEST UH IF YOU TAKE UH TWO PEOPLE ROOM FOR THE READING ROOM THEN YOU HAVE UH SIXTEEN PLACES
YEAH
MM-HMM
SO IT'S STILL SHOULD BE FEASIBLE
WELL SIXTEEN SLOTS FOR FIFTEEN PEOPLE
YEAH THAT THAT ALSO MEANS THAT THE GROWTH WILL BE ZERO
THAT'S
MAYBE WE CAN THINK OF YEAH SOME TWO OR THREE YEAH FOR VISITING PEOPLE
CORRECT
YEAH I THINK THAT'S QUITE IMPORTANT TO MANAGE SOME SPACE
VISITING VISITI VISITING RESEARCHERS STUDENTS COMING FOR EXCHANGE STUDENTS ET CETERA
YEAH
MM-HMM
NOT VERY UH VERY IMPORTANT
UH THE FURNITURE THAT W EACH EACH PERSON HAS AND UH YOU HAVE A LIST OF PEOPLE
OKAY SO LET ME FINISH WITH THE THE CONSTRAINTS WHICH ARE ALMOST DONE
UM OKAY THE OFFICES COMES WITH WHITE BOARDS
SO WE ALSO NEED TO TO FIND THE A SPOT FOR THE PHOTOCOPIER THE FAX MACHINE AND THE PRINTER
THE FAX YOU KNOW IS VERY SMALL BUT UM THE PHOTOCOPIER IS QUITE HUGE AND THE PRINTER IS UH WELL AB THIS SIZE
SO W
SO THE THING UH YOU YOU OUGHT TO KNOW IS THAT WE'RE NOT THE ONLY ONES THAT W WE'RE THIN THAT THAT ARE THINKING ABOUT UH FOR WELL
UH THE OTHER GROUP WILL ALSO PROPOSE A SOLUTION AND THEN THERE WILL BE ANOTHER NEGOTIATION
ABOUT PUTTING PEOPLE I IN THESE ROOMS
YOUR ASSISTANTS FOR INSTANCE AND AT THE NEXT MEETING WE'LL TRY TO TO COME WITH ONE SOLUTION
UM THERE IS ANOTHER GROUP THAT IS ALSO HAVING DISCUSSIONS
SO THE IDEA IS THAT TODAY WE'LL JUST TRY TO F START SEEING THE MAIN CONSTRAINTS AND THEN YOU HAVE TIME TO TO GO AND THINK ABOUT IT UH ASK THE PEOPLE YOU KNOW
AND IF WE DON'T GET THIS SPACE THEN WHAT HAPPENS
UH IF I IF WE DON'T GET THESE
UM WELL BASICALLY THEY ARE PROMISED TO US SO UH DO DO YOU THINK THERE ARE CHANCES THAT THEY TAKE FROM US ONE OF THE ROOMS OR UH
THESE YEAH
WE J WE STAY WHERE WE ARE
OKAY
YEAH I I I THINK IT'S UH UH YEAH
NO THE THE THE CHANCES MIGHT BE THAT THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE TO PUT IN THAT SPACE
DO YOU THINK THAT WE SHOULD PUT PEOPLE SAY ACCORDING TO PROJECTS FOR INSTANCE
YEAH I YEAH THAT'S ONE OF THE THE PROBLEMS
IN IN THE TABLE THAT UM THAT WE HAVE UH WE ALSO HAVE THE UH UH THE P THE MAIN PROJECTS ON WHICH THE PEOPLE ARE WORKING
UM OKAY SO MAYBE WE COULD TRY TO TO SEE NOW WHAT WOULD BE THE MAIN OPTIONS
MM-HMM
SAY THE GENERAL UH WELL ARRANGEMENT OPTIONS
SO HOW YEAH
I THINK MAYBE WE SHOULD TAKE THIS INTO ACCOUNT AND MAYBE THINK OF SOME OF THE BIGGER ROOMS WITH FOUR PEOPLE ONE BEING TEMPORARY OR OR PART TIME
SO UH UM YOU CAN SPEND QUITE A LOT OF TIME DISCUSSING THINGS SO WHAT WHAT WILL BE THE IMPACT OF WHAT WE WILL COME OUT COME UP WITH
ANDRE SORRY FOR INTERRUPTING BUT UH ONE AGAIN CLARIFICATION QUESTION WHAT IS THE REAL MARGIN OF MANOEUVRE THAT WE HAVE FOR THESE DISCUSSIONS
BECAUSE UH AT LEAST WE ARE HALF PER CENT UH FIFTY PER CENT OF FROM E. P. F. L. AND UH SOMETIMES YOU HAVE MEETINGS WHERE W Y THE THE DECISION IS ALREADY TAKEN
BUT WHAT IS ABSOLUTELY N NOT FIXED IS THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE PEOPLE IN THE ROOMS
OH ACTUALLY WHAT IS FIXED IS THE N THE NUMBER OF ROOMS
THIS WE CANNOT REALLY CHANGE
SO BASICALLY WE ARE ALL THE PERMUTATIONS ARE POSSIBLE AT THE MOMENT
I MEAN AT LEAST NOT US IT WOULD BE MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO GET ANOTHER ANOTHER ROOM FOR INSTANCE
SO ANOTHER WAY OF A
ANOTHER WAY OF ASKING THE QUESTION IS THERE ANY OTHER GROUP ALREADY WORKING ON UH ON THE HOW THIS SHOULD BE UH SHOULD BE ALLOCATED
OR ARE WE THE THE ONE THAT IS SUPPOSED TO DO THE P THE THE P POSITION FOR IT
UM
OR L UH
WELL WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR IS A SOLUTION THAT SUITS EVERYONE AND THAT MAKES THE MAXIMUM OF PEOPLE HAPPY
SO UH THE OTHER GROUP IS UH I DON'T THINK WE HAVE TO SEE THEM AS COMPETITORS BUT THEY ARE JUST TRYING TO TO FIND ANOTHER LOCAL OPTIMUM
BUT WHA WHY WHY DON'T THEY HAVE ANY REPRESENTATIVE HERE
I MEAN
YEAH WHY DIDN'T WE HAVE A MEETING TOGETHER
YEAH WHY DO WE DO IT SEPARATELY
UH THEY HAVE ANOTHER GROUP AND THEN UH UH UH ANDRE AND AGNES WILL DISCUSS ABOUT IT WITH
YOU ARE THE REP REPRESENTATIVE OF THIS GROUP ACTUALLY
UH
YEAH UH UH WE YEAH
IT'S IT'S I THINK WELL THE M THE PEOPLE WHO WHO DECIDED THIS THOUGHT IT WAS THE BEST SOLUTION TO
BUT WE'LL JUST TRY TO FIND AT LEAST TWO SOLUTIONS AND SEE HOW HOW CLOSE THEY ARE ACTUALLY
WELL WE COULD HAVE BEEN EIGHT H SITTING AROUND HERE AND AND TALKING BUT I THINK IT'S IT'S MORE DIFFICULT
MM WELL YOU KNOW FIND TWO TWO KINDS OF OPINIONS
YEAH
I I THINK THAT'S YEAH THERE IS NO REAL COMPETITION BETWEEN THE TWO
YEAH
OKAY
WE'LL PUT THEM PUT HER OR HIM SOMEWHERE ELSE THEN WE WILL DO PLENTY OF WORK FOR NOTHING BECAUSE WE'LL NOT HAVE THIS CONSTRAINT
WE'LL NOT BE AWARE OF THIS CONSTRAINT
IT'S SUPPOSE THAT SOMEBODY FOR SOME STRANGE REASONS WANT TO BE IN THE CORNER AND WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT
NO BUT YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S A STANDARD THING
MM-HMM
WELL
EXACTLY I THINK SO SO TODAY THE GOAL IS NOT TO TO FIND THE SOLUTION TODAY
BUT TO SET SOME CONSTRAINTS AND THEN GO AND SEE THE PEOPLE AND FIND OUT IF THEY HAVE ANY PREFERENCES
OBVIOUSLY WE WON'T BE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE ALL THE THE PREFERENCES BUT AT LEAST WE'LL FIND THE MOST UH THE MOST IMPORTANT ONES
OH OKAY
OKAY
WELL CERTAINLY WE HAVE TO ASK UH PIERRETTE AND UH AND MAGGIE SINCE THEY'RE NOT HERE
BECAUSE THEY ALSO HAVE A LOT OF STUDENTS THAT THEY HAVE TO SEE AS WE DO AND SO THAT'S ANOTHER CONSIDERATION TOO
P S I THINK
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
BUT LET US TRY TO SEE TODAY WHETHER WE PREFER TO ORGANISE PEOPLE SAY BY PROJECTS OR JUST PROFESSOR AND ASSISTANT
UM WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT IT
YOU WHO ARE PART TIME DO YOU THINK YOU CAN COME HERE ON A VERY W WELL REGULAR SCHEDULE OR IS IT PART TIME BUT VARIABLE DURING THE WEEK
YEAH I THINK SO THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK WE KNOW THAT THEY HAVE STUDENTS
M MAYBE YOU COULD COME WITH A CONCRETE PROPOSAL WITH UH NAMES ON IT
OR TO WELL TO BE WITH THEIR ASSISTANT OR EVEN WITH ANOTHER PERSON WORKING ON THE PROJECT
WOULD YOU PREFER TO BE ALONE WOULD YOU PREFER TO BE WITH YOUR ASSISTANT
UM SO SINCE ALL OF YOU HAVE A COPY OF THE UH WELL OF THE DRAWING I THINK FOR THE NEXT TIME
WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY IF THEY PREFER FOR INSTANCE TO BE ALONE
SO THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN MAYBE YEAH ANOTHER SOLUTION IS TO ASK EVERYONE TO PROVIDE UH AN ARRANGEMENT
BUT UH I THINK THAT'S A BIT UH A BIT HARD THEN TO TO WORK OUT
SO WHAT WOULD BE F SAY FIRST YOUR PREFERENCES SINCE LET'S LET'S START WITH US MAYBE TODAY
HMM
ME PERSONALLY I WOULD LIKE TO TO TO SHARE THE OTHER PEOPL N UH THE ROOM WITH ASSISTANTS AS WHEN YOU HAVE PROBLEMS OF NORMAL LIFE
YEAH UH OKAY UH
SO IT'S BETTER TO TO BE WITH A WITH AN ASSISTANT TO SHARE THE ROOM
LIKE UH THE PRINTER DOESN'T WORK UH I DON'T WANT TO ASK THIS TO MY SUPERVISOR
AND SINCE YOU'RE COMING ON THE UH HALF TIME
DO YOU THINK YOU WILL BE ABLE TO GROUP YOUR PRESENCE HERE SAY MONDAY
TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY MORNING OR IS IT GOING TO BE M MUCH MORE RANDOM
UH-HUH
MM-HMM
WHAT UH I DON'T THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO SHARE UH T TO HA TO SHARE THE SAME DESK
UH I STILL WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MY DRAWERS AND THESE THINGS
OKAY
IT'S NO NO WAY WE WE COULD PUT TWO PERSONS AT THE SAME DESK
I THINK IT'S QUITE CLEAR THAT MM EACH PERSON SHOULD HAVE THEIR OWN DESK AND YEAH
UM SO MARTIN YOU ARE ALSO UH HALF TIME AND WELL THE THIRD PERSON IS GISELLA
YEAH I THINK SO TOO
I AGREE WITH THAT
THAT'S
UM THE UH THE THING THAT F IN MY CASE HAS TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IS THAT I WILL HAVE A LOT OF PHONE CALLS
WHE WHE WHERE PART TIME IS IMPORTANT IS THAT IT'S N AN OVERLO LOAD ON A ROOM SO UM FOR SURE IF YOU HAVE A PART TIME PERSON
SO THAT'S NOT NECESSARY WELL IT DEPENDS ON I I HAVE NOTHING AGAINST SHARING A A AN OFFICE WITH SOMEBODY
I D ALREADY DID IT BEFORE SO AND IT WAS PERFECTLY FINE
IT REDUCES THE THE RANGES OF TIME WHERE TOO MANY PEOPLE IN THE ROOM
SO I'LL BE TALKING O O O OVER THE PHONE ALL THE TIME
AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED I PROBABLY MIGHT BE ABLE TO HAVE A KIND OF A REGULAR PRESENCE HERE
YEAH I THINK GROUPING
MM-HMM
OH GREAT
SOME PEOPLE JUST CAN'T WORK
IT JUST HAS TO BE SOMEBODY WHO CAN WORK WHILE SOMEBODY ELSE IS HAVING PHONE CALLS IN THE IN THE ROOM WHICH IS VERY D MUCH DEPENDENT ON PEOPLE
SOME PEOPLE ARE NOT DISTURB AT ALL BY THIS
MM-HMM
OKAY
ARE YOU DISTURBED BY THE PHONE CALLS OF OTHER PEOPLE
AS I'M NOT TEACHING HERE I'M TEACHING AT E. P. F. L. THIS SHOULD SHOULDN'T BE A SUCH A BIG LOAD
BUT UH AND UH WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN BUT IT UH IT WILL NOT BE SO HEAVY HERE UH AT ISSCO IS VISITORS
I'M NOT
SO THAT I WILL HAVE MORE AT E. P. F. L. UH TYPICALLY STUDENTS COMING IN UM OR ASKING FOR THINGS
MM-HMM
SO FOR ME IT IT WILL BE ESSENTIALLY I WILL NOT BE I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BE SILENT IN THE ROOM
BECAUSE I WILL BE COMMUNICATING ALSO THROUGH VOCAL MEANS SO
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YE MM BEFORE UM TALKING MORE ABOUT INDIVIDUAL PREFERENCES IS THERE ANY POSSIBILITY
WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IN THE UH FACULTY OF LAW FOR EXAMPLE THAT THEY ACTUALLY SPLIT ROOMS
AND SO WE WOULD TAKE UH UH ONE OF THE TWO PEOPLE ROOMS AND SPLIT IT
UM INSOFAR AS IN JUST ABOUT EVERY OTHER FACULTY IN THE BUILDING EVERY PROFESSOR HAS THEIR OWN OFFICE
SO ONE OPTION AND THAT BUT THAT WE WOULD NEED TO ASK ABOUT IF WE COULD UH SPLIT ONE OF THE ROOMS UH
AND IT'S IT'S REALLY IT GOES A BIT FAR THAT UH WE HAVE TO HAVE THIS UH ALL THIS SHARING UH
AND YOU WOULD SEE THAT YOU WOULD HAVE THE SAME SIZE OFFICE BUT THAT WOULD GIVE THE PRIVACY
HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
HMM
YEAH
DO YOU GO FOR BOXES FOR INSTANCE
IN THE IN THE BIGGER ROOMS WHERE YEAH YOU KNOW LIKE UH CUBICLES
LIKE CUBICLES
THAT DOESN'T REALLY SOLVE IT UH
HMM
AND SOMETIMES YOU HAVE UH YOU NEED TO HAVE PRIVATE UH DISCUSSIONS WITH SOMEBODY OR WHATEVER SO
I MEAN THERE'S THERE'S REALLY A DIFFERENCE TO HAVING TO HAVE YOUR OWN YEAH
YOU MEAN YOU REALLY WANT TO HAVE WALLS
MM-HMM
FOUR WALLS
YEAH
YEAH SURE SURE
SO AT LEAST SOME OF THE PROFESSORS SINCE YOU ARE FOUR UH COULD COULD GO UH WELL COULD TAKE THESE UH THESE ROOMS
AND QUITE A LOT OF ROOMS WITH TWO PERSONS
UH HOW DO YOU FEEL SUSAN ABOUT THE PROFESSOR SHARING THE ROOM WITH HER ASSISTANTS OR THE ONE WHICH IS THE MOST INVOLVED IN IN THE TEACHING
WELL MAKING A WALL BUT ALSO B MM MAKING A NEW DOOR
YEAH I I I WILL TRY TO FIND OUT WHETHER WE CAN SEPARATE
UM SO AT LEAST FOR THE MOMENT AS YOU CAN SEE THERE ARE UH I CAN SHOW THEM HERE ON THE SCREEN
SO IT'S QUITE A LOT OF UH OF WORK BUT UH I WILL TRY TO FIND THIS OUT FOR THE NEXT TIME
I THINK FOR THE MOMENT THE ANSWER AT LEAST IS NO BECAUSE UM IT'S NOT ONLY
SO THERE ARE THESE TWO ROOMS ON THE LEFT THAT UH ACCOMMODATE ONE PERSON
MM-HMM
YEAH
UM I ALSO HAVE UH A LOT OF PHONE CALLS AND Y YOU KNOW HAVE TO SEE PEOPLE
SO I THAT I HAVE TO BE REALLY CAREFUL ABOUT TOO
INSOFAR AS WHAT WE'VE HAD UP UNTIL NOW BOTH MAGGIE AND PIERRETTE HAVE BEEN HAPPY TO SHARE WITH OTHERS
AND WITH THE OTHER WORK THAT I'M DOING WITH THE RECTORATE UH THAT IS REALLY CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION THAT I'M TREATING
BUT IT'S A PERSONAL PREFERENCE UH
AS YOU KNOW UM I PREFER TO HAVE UH MY OWN OFFICE
SO I MEAN I THINK THAT WE SHOULD STILL CHECK WITH THEM
WELL I I THINK IT'S UH REALLY A MATTER OF PERSONAL PREFERENCE
HMM
HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
THAT'S UH IT'S MUCH EASIER TO ME TO UH TO FORESEE HAVING TWO PEOPLE OF THE SAME POSITION SHARING A ROOM THAN UH
I FULLY AGREE WITH THAT
WELL NOT SHARING WITH EACH OTHER
THEY EACH SHARE WITH AN ASSISTANT
YEAH
YOU OVER THE PHONE TYPICALLY YOU DON'T NECESSARY WANT TO HAVE SOMEBODY WHO WILL BE DEPENDENT ON THAT BUDGET BEING PART OF THE DISCUSSION SO
YEAH YOU YOU YOU ARE DISCUSSING A BUDGET ON THE ON THE PROJECT
OH SORRY BECAUSE BUT THAT THAT'S UH IT'S IT'S TRICKY BECAUSE OF CONFIDENTIALITY REASONS AS YOU SAID
OH SHARING WITH THEIR STUDENTS
YEAH
PAID ON THAT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
SINCE THEY TALK QUITE A LOT OF TO EACH OTHER
UM OKAY
YEAH THAT'S UM THAT'S TRUE
DO YOU THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO PUT TOGETHER IN THE SAME ROOM AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE PEOPLE FROM THE SAME PROJECT
UM MAYBE WE COULD S LOOK A BIT AT THE PROJECTS
NO
NO BECAUSE PRO PROJECT DOESN'T LAST IN TIME
THEY WILL CHANGE
OKAY
MM-HMM
THAT'S WHAT THE ONLY THING THAT WILL NOT OR THAT WILL CHANGE ONLY PROGRESSIVELY IN TIME IS THE STATUS OF THE PEOPLE
MM
WELL YEAH AND SOME OF THE P. H. D. STUDENTS WILL HOPEFULLY FINISH THEIR P. H. D. AT SOME POINT
YEAH THEY WILL PROMOTE THAT
BUT STILL TH SOME THINGS WELL YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH AND ALSO SOME OF OUR THE PEOPLE MENTIONED HERE ARE WORKING ON MORE THAN ONE PROJECT TOO
SO
YEAH
BUT I'M NOT SAYING THAT I NECESSARILY WANT TO BE WITH HER IN THE OFFICE
BUT UH IT'S JUST TO SAY PEOPLE ARE WORKING ON UH SOMETIMES MORE THAN ONE PROJECT UH
FOR EXAMPLE UH MARIANNE DE UH SHE'S ALSO WORKING WITH ME ON THE VIRTUAL CAMPUS PROJECT SO SHE THAT ONE WASN'T MENTIONED
MM-HMM
UH-HUH
OKAY YEAH
MM-HMM
THEY JUST HAVE A MEETING ROOM IF IT'S NOT TOO FAR AWAY THEN THEN IT'S A VERY GOOD GOOD PRACTICE
IF YOU NEED TO HAVE PEOPLE IN A PROJECTS TALKING TOGETHER
IF IF IT IF I IF PROJECTS ARE WHAT YOU HAVE IN MIND I THINK THAT UH MEETING ROOM IS THE THE TOOL FOR THAT
YEAH
YEAH
YEP
YEAH
WELL ACTUALLY SO THE LOUNGE COULD SERVE AS SOME KIND OF MEETING ROOM
BUT THERE ARE ALSO MORE FORMAL MEETING ROOMS AVAILABLE IN IN THE BUILDING AS WE NOW KNOW
YES
DO WE WANT TO HAVE ONLY A LOUNGE OR S SOMETHING THAT CAN BE USED ONLY AS A READING ROOM
THAT'S WHY I WAS QUITE RECEPTIVE TO UH SUSAN'S REMARK AT THE BEGINNING IS I WOULDN'T FORMULATE IT IN A SUCH A AN EXTREME WAY AS
BUT UH I WOULD P PROBABLY FORMULATE IT IN THE WAY THAT UH
DO WE REALLY NEED THE LOUNGE
MM-HMM
BECAUSE BECAUSE MEETING ROOMS TO ME ARE VERY IMPORTANT TOOLS TO DO UH COLLABORATIVE WORK
MM-HMM
SO I THINK WE NEED A
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND WE ALSO HAVE TO RELAX SO THAT'S
YEAH AND AND I THINK ALSO WE NEED A SEPARATE DISCUSSION ON THE FURNISHING OF THE LOUNGE WHICH IS A WHOLE OTHER TOPIC
YES
NO I D UM THE LOUNGE OKAY
SO THEY ACTUALLY HAVE A PLACE TO WORK
WELL YEAH WE'LL SKIP THAT FOR NOW
BUT I THINK WE NEED TO ALSO SEE IT AS A OVERFLOW PLACE WHEN WE HAVE UM UH VISITORS FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME
YES
YEAH
YEAH
'CAUSE THAT'S REALLY MY ONE OF MY WORRIES WITH THE PLAN THAT WE HAVE HERE IS THAT IT'S IT PR PROVIDES NO POSSIBLE POSSIBILITIES OF EXPANSION
UH-HUH
I MEAN YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T PREVENT HAVING VISITORS
AND YOU SHOULDN'T
AND THIS WILL HAPPEN
UM
NO YOU WANT TO HAVE VISITORS
YEAH
UH THAT IS YEAH
YEAH YEAH FOR THE MOMENT ACTUALLY I THINK ONLY ONE SLOT WOULD BE FULLY FREE
WHICH FOR FOR FIFTEEN PEOPLE IT'S NOT ENOUGH
I MEAN UH
YEAH THAT MEANS ONE VISITOR AT A TIME
OR ONE INTERN
YEAH THAT'S MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH IT'S WE HAVE WE HAVE FOUR PROFESSORS HERE AND AND AND TWO RESEARCHERS
IT'S
IT'S FUNNY THAT UH WE MOVE TO ANOTHER BUILDING BECAUSE WE RUN OUT OF UH SPACE AND WE WILL HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM
MM-HMM
MM
YES BUT WE HAVE MORE SPACE HERE THAN WHAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE SO IT'S AT LEAST SOME
AH OKAY
AND YOU'RE YOU'RE WORKING UH I THINK YEAH W OKAY
YEAH IT'S ALREADY IN PROGRESS
SO ONE OF THE THINGS I HAVE TO DO FOR THE NEXT TIME IS FIN FIND OUT ABOUT THE SEPARATIONS BETWEEN ROOMS AND
IT'S BAD IT'S BAD
UH IT'S NOT NECESSARY HEAVY IN TERMS OF WORK
BECAUSE THIS IS REALLY RELATED WITH SECURITY UH REGULATION AS WELL
I MEAN YOU CAN'T JUST PUT WALLS IN IN ROOMS WITHOUT ANY SPECIFIC AUTHORIS YEAH
IT'S HEAVY IN TERMS OF ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORISATION
YEAH I THINK IT'S QUITE A HEAVY TRANSFORMATION OF THE BUILDING
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
AND OKAY I'LL TRY TO FIND OUT
AND THE OTHER QUESTION IS CAN WE SQUEEZE MAYBE FOUR PEOPLE IN THE UH OR AT LEAST FOUR PLACES IN THE THREE THREE P. ROOM
AT LEAST AT E. P. F. L.
I THINK SO
IF YOU ORGANISE THE DESKS IN A IN A INTELLIGENT WAY
MM-HMM
UM
MM-HMM
UH OKAY
SO THAT'S UH I HAVE TO TO ASK SO YOU DON'T REALLY FEEL UM VERY STRONGLY ATTACHED TO THIS UH GROUPING BY PROJECTS IDEA
YEAH HOPEFULLY VISITORS DON'T NEED AS MUCH SAY FILING SPACE OR UM YEAH THEY DON'T HAVE THAT MANY PAPERS
YEP
YEAH RIGHT THAT'S THE POINT
NO
NO
NO BECAUSE THEY CAN SHARE THEIR IDEAS ACROSS THE PROJECT YEAH I WOULD SAY
COFFEE MACHINES ARE THAT MADE FOR THAT
YEAH EXACTLY
BUT UH USUALLY WHE WHEN NEW ASSISTANTS COME
THEY WOULD LIKE TO SHARE THE ROOM WITH SOMEONE THAT KNOWS UH L UH IT'S RELATED WITH THE PROJECT SO HE CAN
MM-HMM
NO THAT'S THAT'S PROXIMITY DOESN'T PLAY A BIG ROLE THERE
WE CAN DISCUSS WITH PEOPLE THAT THE THE SPACE IS VERY SMALL I MEAN ALTOGETHER IT'S
MM-HMM
YEAH THEY THEY CAN CHANGE
MM
MM-HMM
HOW DO I GET FURNITURE I'M I DON'T HAVE A A PENCIL WHERE IS THE THE BOX WITH THE PENCILS AND SO ON
THIS IS NOT PROJECT RELATED
AND UH YOU DON'T Y YOU DON'T NEED TO DISCUSS ABOUT THE PROJECTS YOU F MORE NEED ABOUT TH TO DISCUSS ABOUT WHERE IS THE PRINTER
NO OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
UH BRUNO AND AGNES ARE SHARING AN OFFICE AND THEY'RE WORKING ON TOTALLY DIFFERENT PROJECTS AND AND THEY'RE THEY'RE JUST FINE WITH THAT
NO AND IF YOU LOOK NOW AT THEIR UH THE THE CURRENT DIVISION OF THE OFFICES FOR EXAMPLE
MM-HMM
YEAH
UM ARE YOU AWARE F OF ANY STRONG CONSTRAINTS RIGHT NOW
YEAH
I THINK THAT'S THAT'S GOING TO BE ONE OF THE THE MAIN THINGS WE'LL HAVE TO ASK IS WHETHER PEOPLE HAVE STRONG PREFERENCES EITHER IN STAYING WITH SOMEONE OR IN UH NOT STAYING
BECAUSE BEFORE WE WERE GROUPING THE SMOKERS AND NOW THAT THERE'S NO SMOKING UH I GUESS THAT'S NOT VERY IMPORTANT OPTION THOUGH
WELL THERE THERE WERE BUT THEY SORT OF DISAPPEARED AS OF OCTOBER WHEN THE NO SMOKING RULE CAME IN
OH
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
SO SMOKING IS NOW UM NO LONGER A CONSTRAINT
OKAY YEAH THAT'S TRUE
WELL EXCEPT FOR THAT MAYBE YOU DON'T EVEN WANT ANYBODY SMOKING ON YOUR BALCONY SO
YEAH
IS IT ALLOWED TO SMOKE INSIDE AN OFFICE IF IT'S A ONE PERSON NO NOT ANY MORE
NO
NO
SO YOU CAN GO OUTSIDE ONTO THE BALCONY TO SMOKE
YOU CAN SMOKE OUTSIDE
NOT EVEN IN THE CAFETERIA
NO
NO N IT'S IN IN PRINCIPLE IT'S A IT'S A NO SMOKING BUILDING
IT'S NON SMOKING CAMPUS
MM-HMM
NOT EVEN IN THE CAFETERIA
DOWNSTAIRS
FULL NO SMOKING BUILDING FOR ALL OF THE SIX THOUSAND STUDENTS
YEAH
THAT'S THE NEW REGULATION
OKAY
WOW
ON THE ROOF MAYBE
YEAH
NORMALLY
UH ON THE BALCONY ACTUALLY
YEAH
YEP
THE BALCONY OKAY
THERE IS THE THERE'S THAT TERRACE
BUT ANDRE UH JUST A
WOW THERE THERE'S NO PLACE IN INSIDE THE BUILDING
WOW E. T. P. F. L. IS A C IT'S A NON SMOKING CAMPUS BUT THERE ARE SOME PLACES THA
NO
BUT THEY PREFER TO HAVE VIEW ON THE OLD TOWN SO THEY WOULD BE IN THE TOILETS
WHERE PEOPLE ARE WITH OTHER PEOPLES AND THEY WILL FIND POLITICALLY CORRECT WAYS TO TELL YOU THAT UH THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE A VIEW ON THE MOUNTAINS
SO YOU PROPOSE A SET UP
I I DON'T THINK THAT ANYONE WILL PROVIDE YOU INFORMATION SUCH AS WHO DOESN'T WANT TO BE WITH WHOM
BUT ANDRE JUST A COMMENT ABOU ABOUT YOUR YOUR PREVIOUS UH REQUEST
THAT'S A TYPICAL UH OUTPUT OF EX UH RESEARCH IN EXPERT SYSTEMS
BUT UH YOU CAN GET THEM THROUGH A PROPOSAL
STILL SOME PLACES WHERE SMOKERS CAN SURVIVE
THEY WOULD UM P PREFER TO BE IN ANOTHER ROOM
THESE ARE THE RULES THAT YOU NEVER GET
YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
THE OTHER WAY
MM-HMM
O ON THE TOILETS OR
MM-HMM
NO WE WE DO HAVE ONE CONSTRAINT THAT'S DIFFICULT WHICH IS UH GISELLA BECAUSE WHEN SHE'S THERE SHE'S VERY NOISY
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
SHE'S ON THE PHONE A LOT IT'S JUST IT'S BY YEAH
IT'S BY NAT UH BY THE NATURE OF HER WORK THAT UH A LOT OF IT IS COMMUNICATION
YEAH
BUT THAT'S A SEC S THAT'S THE ADMIN THAT'S THE ADMIN UH SO IT'S PART OF THE WORK
YES MARTIN SAID ALSO FOR HIM AND YEAH ESPECIALLY FOR HER
YEAH THE IN SHE'S THE INTERFACE
SO MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEP
AND UH IF YOU PUT TWO PERSON PERSONS OR THREE PERSONS FOR THE ADMIN SPACE WHO WHO WHO ELSE WOULD YOU PUT IN THERE
BECAUSE BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A ONE PERSON WE D WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH ONE PERSON ROOMS FOR UH ACCOMMODATING THE UH THE ADMIN PLACE
AND THAT THAT'S A PROBLEM YOU'RE RIGHT
YEP
MM-HMM
MAYBE YOU COULD PUT SOME VISITORS BUT UM
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ANY ASSISTANT MANAGER OR WE DON'T HAVE WE HAVE ONLY ONE HALF PART HALF TIME UH ADMIN AND NO OTHER NON RESEARCHER POSITIONS IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN
AND THIS IS REALLY A PIECE OF A PROBLEM
YEAH
YEP
IT WOULD BE NICE BUT UH OKAY I'LL TRY TO FIND OUT BUT UH
I THINK PUTTING GISELLA WITH THE OTHER ADMIN OF THE SCHOOL IS NOT AN OPTION BECAUSE WE WEREN'T OFFERED YEAH
YEAH I THINK YEAH
MM-HMM
I KNOW
IT'S NOT VERY UH REALISTIC IN A IN A IN AN ADMIN ROOM BUT UH
I THINK THAT'S A EXCELLENT IDEA
WHY DON'T WE ASK ABOUT THAT
YEAH BECAUSE
YOU CAN'T PUT A RESEARCHER THERE
THAT'S JUST EITHER YOU LOSE ONE POSITION OR YOU FIND ANOTHER ADMIN OR ASSISTANT MANAGER
I TH
YEAH
WI IF ALL OF THOSE UH UH OFFICES THAT ARE WHERE HALF OF THEM ARE ALSO HALF TIME AND THEY'RE VERY UNDER USED
SO UM
I MEAN THERE IS CERTAINLY ENOUGH SPACE UH DOWN THE HALL
YEAH
YOU KNOW PEOPLE JUST DON'T WANNA CHANGE IN GENERAL
UM LET'S SEE MAYBE WE CAN FIND SOME TEMPORARY WELL AT LEAST A PROPOSAL FOR GISELLA
SO SINCE THE ONE PERSON ROOMS ARE QUITE WELL SORT OF UM DESIRED BY A LOT OF PEOPLE SHE SHOULD PROBABLY NO Y YEAH
OKAY
OKAY WE'LL TRY BUT ALL THESE YEAH ARE SAY SORT OF DIFFICULT QUESTIONS BECAUSE THEY INVOLVE CHANGING ALSO THE OFFICES OF THE SCHOOL AND
YEP
THE OTHER THING IS TO TAKE A TWO PERSON ROOM FOR THE ADMIN
UH THE THERE ARE TO ME THERE ARE TWO OPTIONS POSSIBLE IS EITHER YOU WE CAN TAKE ONE OF THE ONE PERSON ROOMS FOR THE ADMIN
SHARING EITHER WITH A COLLEAGUE OR SHARING UH WITH SOME OF THEIR UH ONE OF THEIR P. H. D. STUDENTS
BECAUSE SOME OF TYPICALLY THE PROFESSORS HAVE GOOD REASONS FOR SHARING
IN THAT CASE IT'S IT'S REALISTIC
THAT COULD BE THE ONE UH CLOSE TO THE UH CLOSE TO THE HERE IN THE CENTRE SO UH THE YEAH
NO THAT'S NOT SURE THAT'S NOT SURE
AND THAT WOULD SOLVE THE PROBLEM
THEN WE COULD VERY VERY SIMPLY UH ALLOCATE THE ONE PERS ONE OF THE ONE PERSON ROOMS FOR THE ADMIN
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OKAY
UH THE THE MIDDLE ONE HERE
BUT THEN UH THAT THE THE QUESTION OF WHAT DO WE DO WITH THE SECOND POSITION THERE REMAINS FULLY OPEN
BUT THA NO NO NO THE OTHER ONE THE THE ONE OP YEAH HERE THIS ONE
THIS ONE
OKAY
WELL
MM-HMM
IF THEY REALLY
LET'S SAY THE AT LEAST THE TWO FULL FULL TIME PROFESSORS THAT ARE HERE ON THE LIST WE HAVE ONE HERE BUT UH MAGGIE IS IS NOT PRESENT
SO I WOULD BE I WOULD BE MORE OF THE OPINION TO TO SEE WHETHER IT'S IT'S SO EVIDENT THAT
YEAH
MM-HMM
AND PIERRETTE TOO
YEAH AND PIERRETTE
I MEAN IT'S IT'S CERTAINLY NOT UH SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD IMPOSE BUT WE CAN ASK
IF IF IF BECAUSE OF PERSONAL PREFERENCES THEY WOULD BE HAPPY WITH A TWO PERSON ROOM WHICH MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT BE THE CASE
YEAH
YEAH WELL
MM-HMM
YEAH
GISELLA COULD TAKE ONE OF THE THE TWO PERSON ROOMS AND THE OTHER PLACE WOULD BE FOR SOME KIND OF VISITOR THAT
YEAH BECAUSE IN THIS CASE YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH BUT THAT'S NOT REALISTIC EITHER
I MEAN YOU HAVE YOU HAVE A FORE FOREIGN RESEARCHER COMING VISITING YOU AND YOU WILL PUT PUT HIM IN THE ADMIN OFFICE
I OR
OKAY
UH
AH
UH YOU'LL NOT DO THAT
I MEAN UH MAYBE YOU CAN DO THAT WITH AN EXCHANGE STUDENT THAT'S
YEAH WITH WITH YOUNGER PEOPLE YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH OR AN INTERN
BUT YOU CAN'T TAKE A SENIOR VISITOR AND UH HIM IN THE IN THE SECRETARY
NO
SO WE WE INVITE INVITE AND THEN WE SAY OKAY YOU CAN SIT WITH GISELLA
UH YOU'RE HERE
UM ACTUALLY YEAH MAYBE WE SHOULD REMIND THAT QUITE A LOT OF PROFESSORS AT THE AT THE SCHOOL ACTUALLY SHARE THEIR OFFICE WITH THEIR ASSISTANT
OKAY
MAYBE NOT TO BE FOLLOWED
YEAH
OKAY SO THIS SETS A BIT THE STAGE FOR UH FOR GISELLA THEN
UH YEAH WE'LL TRY TO TO FIND OUT
SO B IT LOOKS LIKE SORT OF AN IMPLICIT TRADITION
UM
AS SUSAN SAID P
EXCEPT FOR IN EVERY OTHER FACULTY
OKAY
IS THAT SO
YEAH
YES IT IS SO
EVERY OTHER FACULTY AS FAR AS I HAVE SEEN THEIR OFFICES AND THE PEOPLE THAT I KNOW AND THAT'S IN UM IN LAW
OH
MM-HMM
YEAH
I MEAN IN IN THE IN THE LAW FACULTY THEY'RE AT BEST THERE HALF TIME
IT'S A THEY ALL HAVE THEIR OWN OFFICE
UH SOCIO ECONOMICS UH OKAY
OKAY
NO NO THAT'S IT
IT CANNOT BE IMPOSED FOR SURE
IT'S UH
AS WE SAID IT'S IT'S REALLY A MATTER OF PERSONAL PREFERENCE IT CANNOT BE SOMETHING ELSE
MM-HMM
YEAH
UH COULD WE TRY SO COULD YOU TRY PLEASE TO UH DO YOU WANT AN EXTRA UH PIECE OF PAPER
MAYBE TRY TO WELL THINK ON YOUR OWN AND THEN TALK A LITTLE BIT JUST TO THE PEOPLE AROUND YOU
UM OKAY SO I THINK WELL THIS SETS A BIT UH THE STAGE
JOB
AGAIN UH UH UM ANDRE I THINK THAT THE ONLY REALISTIC WAY WE CAN DO IS TO SPEAK FOR OUR FOR OURSELVES
I CAN TELL YOU ACCORDING TO WHAT I KNOW NOW WHERE I WOULD LIKE OR WOULD BE READY TO BE
BUT I REALLY DON'T SEE HOW I COULD DECIDE FOR UH MAGGIE OR PIERRETTE OR WHOEVER ELSE ON THE LIST THAT THEY SHOULD BE THERE
MM-HMM
NO THE POINT WAS TO TRY TO WELL JUST TALK TO THEM TO DAVID OR
YEAH
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
YEAH B WHY WHY COULDN'T WE DO LIKE COULDN'T WE DO IT LIKE FOR FOR THE THE SET UP OF MEETINGS
YOU YOU EVERYONE RECEIVED THAT AND UH SHOULD PROVIDE YEAH I WOULD LIKE TO BE HERE
AND THEN YOU WILL HAVE THIS MULTI CONSTRAINT PROBLEM AND UH YOU WORK DURING TWO HOURS AND YOU COME UP WITH THE OPTIMAL SOLUTION
MM-HMM
YEAH
SO W W W WILL YOU ASK PEOPLE JUST FOR THEIR PLACE OR ALSO FOR THE OTHER PEOPLE'S PLACE
BECAUSE UH-HUH
I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S THE IMPORTANT THING YOU WANT TO KNOW
YEAH I WOULD I WOULD ASK FOR THEIR PLACE
WELL BUT THAT'S
IT'S ALTOGETHER
I MEAN WE ARE GOING TO PURCHASE A CAFETERIA WITH A PROJECTOR AND ALL THIS ALTOGETHER OR READING ROOM YEAH
W WHAT ABOU WHAT ABOUT THE THE THE CAFETERIA
UH IT'S A READING ROOM
READING ROOM IT'S NOT A CAFETERIA
SO IN THE LIVING ROOM
OR AS UH SUSAN SAID A ROOM AN EMERGENCY ROOM WHERE YOU CAN PUT UH SOME VISITORS IN A DECENT ENVIRONMENT FOR FOR FOR FOR WORK
BUT THAT'S THAT'S REALLY AN OPEN DISCUSSION AND THAT D I THINK NO DECISION NO FINAL DECISION HAS BEEN TAKEN ABOUT THAT
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A MIXED ROOM WHERE YOU CAN HAVE A READING ROOM FOR SURE BUT ALSO MEETING ROOM IF NECESSARY
BUT THAT THAT'S AN OPEN QUESTION WHETHER IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A IT AT THE ORIGIN IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A F PURE READING ROOM FOR RELAXING
UH THERE HAS BEEN A VERY LONG DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT
UH READING THE NEWSPAPERS ET CETERA ET CETERA
I STINCT UH THIS DISCUSSION IS STILL VIVID THAT SOME OF THE PEOPLE I BEL BELONG TO THESE PEOPLE
BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER PLACE TO DO IT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
THAT'S QUITE EASY PROBABLY TO STATE NOW THAT YOU KNOW THE CONSTRAINTS
OR IF YOU CAN POLL A LITTLE BIT THE PEOPLE AROUND YOU THAT WOULD BE I MEAN EVEN
OKAY TH THEN OKAY THEN FOR THE NEXT TIME UM TRY TO COME UP EITHER WITH YOUR OWN PREFERENCES
YES
YES
THE ONE THAT I DON'T WANT TO HAVE IN THE NEXT ROOM
AND I THINK YEAH IT WILL BE NICE TO TO COME WITH MAYBE A SKETCH OF OF THESE
AND UH WE'LL TRY TO AT LEAST BUILD UP ONE COHERENT PROPOSAL AND WE'LL MERGE IT WITH THE OTHER ONE WHEN THE OTHER ONE UH IS AVAILABLE
IF YOU CAN DO SLIDES IT'S EVEN BETTER BUT UH DON'T BE THAT FORMAL
WELL JUST DISCUSS I YEAH FOR INSTANCE I MEAN NO NO I WAS THINKING JUST ASK PEOPLE AROUND YOU WHAT THEY THINK ABOUT THIS
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY I'LL ASK UM UH MAGGIE AND PIERRETTE UH IF THEY HAVE UH ANY PREFERENCES
OH GREAT
UM
THAT WOULD BE GREAT
THAT WOULD BE GREAT
MM-HMM
PERFECT
C THAT THAT OF COURSE IS ONE OF THE MAIN WELL NOT MAIN BUT ONE OF THE IMPORTANT FEATURES THAT WE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT
YEAH
YEAH
NO
YEAH SINCE THEY'RE NOT AT THE MEETING I THINK IT'S IN OUT OF COURTESY WE SHOULD FIRST ASK THEM
YES
AND I'LL TRY TO
YES
BU I JU JUST BEFORE FINISHING UH I MEAN WE HAVE A CAFETERIA OR WE DON'T EAT AT ALL
FINE
WE DON'T HAVE CAFETERIA
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY CAFETERIA EXACTLY
HE MEANS READING ROOM
A PLACE N WHAT MM UH WE CAN TAKE A COFFEE ALSO
WHAT
NO THERE IS NO COFFEE IN THE READING ROOM
NO
YEAH W WE CAN BRING YOUR COFFEE IN THE READING ROOM BUT
THAT WAS THE WRONG WE WE DID NOT HAVE ANY MONEY FOR BUYING THE COFFEE MACHINES SO
THERE ARE AT LEAST TWO UM COFFEE MACHINES IN THE BUILDING ONE AT THE THIRD FLOOR ONE AT THE FIRST FLOOR

THANK YOU
HEY LOOK THESE ARE MICROPHONES THEY UH THEY'RE FOR WOMEN'S SHIRTS
NO NO IT'S THE OPPOSITE
UM OKAY SO UM LET'S START
WORKING PLACES TO TO PUT UM MAY I FIRST UH PROVIDE THE ANSWERS TO THE THE QUESTIONS FROM THE LAST TIME
UM THANKS FOR COMING AGAIN TO THIS MEETING
I HOPE IT WON'T BE TOO LONG AND ESPECIALLY THAT WE'LL MAKE SOME PROGRESS ON UH THIS UH ON THIS SMALL TASK THAT IS PUTTING PEOPLE IN OUR NEW ROOMS
AND WE HAD ABOUT FIFTEEN PEOPLE AND SOME UH SPARE UH SPARE MM WELL
SO WE HAVE THESE ONE PERSON TWO PERSON AND THREE PERSON ROOMS
UM AND SO THAT MAKES I THINK EIGHTEEN PLACES
UH I HOPE YOU HAD FUN IN UH WELL DESIGNING SOMETHING OR UH ASKING THE PEOPLE ABOUT THEIR PREFERENCES AND UH THINGS LIKE THIS
SO YEAH THAT'S WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT IT'S FOR WOMEN'S SHIRTS
UM SO UM WELL I THINK YOU REMEMBER ALL THE CONSTRAINTS AND THE NEW SETTINGS
I THINK YOU'LL BE MORE AND MORE USED TO IT AS AS SOON AS WE MOVE
AND I ALSO CHECKED WITH UH MAGGIE AND PIERRETTE
WE HAVE TO DO WITH THIS SETTING AND UH IT'S IT'S QUITE DIFFICULT TO MAKE NEW DOORS AND NEW WALLS
OH GREAT YEAH
AND THEY DON'T WANT US TO SH I MEAN THEY DON'T WANT TO PROVIDE AN EXTRA WORKING SPACE FOR GISELLA WITH THE OTHER I. T. ADMINS
SO I THINK WE SHOULDN'T COUNT ON THEM IN THE NEXT UH FOUR YEARS MAYBE
SO THAT WILL BE PART OF THE YOUR UH YOUR SOLUTION OR SUGGESTIONS TO SOLUTION
BUT REGARDING THE CONSTRAINTS UM THERE IS NO IMMEDIATE PLAN TO TO MAKE SEPARATIONS BETWEEN THE ROOMS SO THAT MEANS BASICALLY WELL
WHICH WE COULD UNDERSTAND BECAUSE IT'S SORT OF FULL OVER THERE BUT UH AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT THEY SAID
GREAT
COME NOW IT'S NOT FULL OVER THERE
SO UH THE ONE UH HERE
SO REGARDING THE POSSIBILITY TO PUT FOUR PEOPLE IN ONE OF THE TWO UH THREE PERSON ROOMS
THOUGH IT WOULDN'T BE A BAD THING MAYBE BUT UH WE'LL SEE
IT IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE AT LEAST ON THE ONE THAT IS A BIT UH LONGER ON ON THE RIGHT
UM WELL IT'S NOT VERY EASY WE'LL HAVE TO PLAY UH QUITE UH QUITE WISELY WITH THE FURNISHING
SO IT SEEMS WE UH YEAH THE WELL WE CANNOT CHANGE THE HABITS OF THE WHOLE SCHOOL JUST FOR US
IF WE COULD AVOID IT IT WOULD MUCH SIMPLIFY THINGS BUT UH WELL WE'LL SEE
IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE TO PUT FOUR PERSONS
THE THE QUESTION IS IS IT IS IT AGAINST THE REGULATION SECURITY REGULATION OF THE SCHOOL
THAT'S THAT'S THE IMPORTANT POINT
NO
NO NO NO
AND AND I AND I WENT OVER AND I LOOKED AT THAT ROOM TOO
NO UH NO
THERE'S PLENTY OF SPACE FOR FOUR PEOPLE
OKAY
YEAH I THINK YEAH
IT IT'S MORE A MATTER OF HOW TO ARRANGE THE FURNITURE BUT UH SINCE WE ARE EXPERTS AT THIS TASK UH OKAY
SO MAYBE WE COULD COUNT ON ON FOUR PLACES BUT THE FINAL DECISION IS NOT REALLY OURS SO UH WE'LL SEE ACTUALLY THIS
YEAH
SO ME FOR EXAMPLE
THAT WOULD BE FINE IF ONE OF THE PERSON IS FIFTY PER CENT
WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO START OR WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO END
UM OKAY SO THESE WERE THE UM THE ANSWERS
EXACTLY
SO ACTUALLY I I DID MY UH MY PROPOSAL AS A SLIDE
OR ONE OF THE INTERN POSITIONS THE PEOPLE WHO MIGHT COME OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
IT'S UH
AH
EXACTLY
YEAH
MM
WELL JUST T JUST TO UH UH COMPLETE UH I TALKED BOTH WITH MAGGIE AND PIERRETTE AND BOTH OF THEM ARE HAPPY TO SHARE OFFICES
THEY HAVE NO PROBLEM WHATSOEVER
PLEASE
OH GREAT
BECAUSE THEY WORK ON THE SWISSTRA TOGETHER AND THEY LIKE TO GOSSIP TOGETHER SO
UH THEY'RE THEY'RE EASY BUT UH COULD BE UH AS PIERRETTE HAS RIGHT NOW THAT SHE COU SHE IS HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO SHARE WITH UH MARIANNE
UH AND AND MAGGIE FOR EXAMPLE TO SHARE WITH UH IT COULD BE WITH BRUNO
MM-HMM
OKAY OKAY
OKAY THEN LET ME UM EXPLAIN VERY BRIEFLY THE THE RATIONALE FOR FOR THIS
BEAUTIFUL
UM HELLO
SO IT'S THE SAME UH SCHEMA THAT YOU KNOW
IN RED YOU HAVE THE UH UH OH EXCUSE ME THAT'S QUITE UH ANNOYING EXCUSE ME
YES
THAT LOOKS GOOD
OH YEAH UM CAN I CAN I CALL YOU A BIT LATER IN ABOUT HALF AN HOUR
I'M JUST IN THE MIDDLE OF A MEETING AND I'M TALKING
PEOPLE SH YEAH THAT'S
IT'S FANTASTIC
PEOPLE WHO DON'T TURN OFF THEIR PHONE IN A MEETING
OH OKAY THANK YOU
BYE BYE
UM SORRY FOR THIS
UM
UM SO THE NAMES ARE IN RED
OKAY SO LET ME GET BACK TO INTO THE PROPOSAL AFTER THE BRIEF INTERRUPTION
BECAUSE I I THINK THAT SOMETIMES THEY JU THEY JUST DISCUSS TOGETHER AND UH IT'S EASIER IF THEY ARE IN THE SAME OFFICE
FORTUNATELY WE WERE JUST UH THE FOUR OF US
NOW UM WELL ONE OF THE REASONS AT LEAST FOR ME FOR DOING THIS WAS TO MORE OR LESS GROUP PEOPLE UH WITH WITHIN PROJECTS
S
LET ME CHECK THAT I I DI I DIDN'T
OR AT LEAST UH DON'T DON'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT BEING WITH THEIR ASSISTANTS
SO I WAS HAPPY TO HEAR SUSAN UH SAYING THAT MAGGIE AND BRUNO COULD WELL TOGETHER AND PIERRETTE AND UH MARIANNE IN IN THE SAME OFFICE
AND UM WHICH IS QUITE HAPPY ACTUALLY I I ALSO THOUGHT THAT SOME PROFESSORS MIGHT ENJOY
YEAH
WELL HAVING HER OWN OFFICE SO UH IT'S IT'S IT'S WORKING LIKE THIS
I DON'T KNOW
UM SO WHAT I CAN SAY IS UH THAT I ALSO UNDERSTOOD THAT SUSAN WOULD BE RATHER IN FAVOUR OF UH
SO I THINK THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO JUST STAY THERE AND STARE OUTSIDE
IT'S ALSO ONE OF THE ROOMS WITH THE FEWER UH THE FEWEST UH WINDOWS
UH BUT IT'S IT'S NICER TO HAVE A NICER VIEW FROM YOUR OFFICE I GUESS
YEAH MAYBE I THOUGHT IN AN ANGLE BUT THAT'S OBVIOUSLY NOT VERY
I PUT THE LOUNGE IN THE MIDDLE
YES
YEAH BUT PUTTING THE PRINTER IN THE LOUNGE IS JUST KILLING THE LOUNGE
IT'S NOT A QUESTION WHERE IT IS IT'S A QUESTION OF YOU ARE PRINTING ALL THE TIME SO
NO YEAH
YEAH WHY NOT PUT THE PRINTER OUT IN THE HALLWAY
HERE
OKAY AND SO NEXT TO THE PHOTOCOPY MAYBE IT WOULDN'T BE A BAD PLACE
OKAY
YEAH
UH
YEAH THAT'S THAT'S A POSSIBLE
YEAH
WHY NOT
IT IS THERE ENOUGH SPACE THERE FOR A PHOTOCOPY AND PRINTER
SO UH I. M. TWO IS MORE OR LESS IN THE UPPER LEFT SIDE
UM I SAID MORE OR LESS UM UH UPPER UH LOWER LEFT SIDE UH YOU HAVE SWISSTRA AND SO THE TWO PROJECTS FROM THE LIST
SO OKAY BUT UH I WOULDN'T WELL INSIST ON THIS I THINK OKAY SO THE PRINTER
WELL WE'LL REMOVE IT IF WE WORK FROM THIS UH THIS SOLUTION
YEAH WE'LL HAVE TO CHECK THA YEAH BUT THE PRINTER IS QUITE SMALL IF WE FI FIND JUST A SMALL TABLE FOR IT
AND THEN ON THE ON THE RIGHT SIDE
MAYBE ONE DAY WE'LL HAVE A PHOTOCOPY THAT IS ALSO A PRINTER
THE PHOTOCOPY IS A BIT BIG
UH IF YOU WANT WE CAN USE THIS DOCUMENT OR WE COULD JUST SAY
IF YOU CAN SUGGEST SOMETHING UH BETTER BECAUSE SHE'S WITH TWO PEOPLE WHO UH WELL TWO P. H. D. STUDENTS
AND IT'S TRUE THAT SHE HAS YEAH A LOT OF PHONE CALLS TO MAKE BUT UM IT'S SOME WAY TO TO SOLVE SOME CONSTRAINTS
I THINK THIS IS A VERY OPEN THING
MAYBE NOT A VER A VERY GOOD SOLUTION FOR GISELLA
FIRST LISTEN TO YOUR SUGGESTIONS AND SEE IF WE ERASE EVERYTHING OR JUST DO SOME MODIFICATIONS USING THIS ONE
WELL I'VE A QUESTION
WHAT'S THE JUSTIFICATION FOR GIVING NANCY HER OWN OFFICE
THEN THEY MAYBE YOU ARE YOU HAVE BETTER SUGGESTIONS
UM YEAH MAYBE NOT A VERY STRONG ONE
YEAH THERE IS NO STRONG CONSTRAINT AND UH WELL
UM IT WAS I THINK SORT OF ONE OF THE UH PLACES THEY RE THAT REMAIN AND I I THINK
SHE'S A SMOKER BUT THE POLICY IS THAT WE DON'T SMOKE SO IT'S EVEN BETTER IF SHE'S UH WITH A SECOND PERSON
UH I WOULD HAVE I WOULD HAVE A PROVOCATIVE SUGGESTION TO PUT GISELLA TO SWITCH NANCY AND GISELLA
MM DOESN'T HELP YEAH
UH-HUH
OKAY
PUT GISELLA THE FAX AND THE PRINTING MACHINE THE PRINTER IN THE ONE PERSON ROOM AS A AS A
UH-HUH
WE TRIED THAT AND GISELLA REALLY DIDN'T LIKE TO HAVE A PRINTER AND PEOPLE IN AND OUT ALL THE TIME AND UH
WELL GISELLA WILL NOT BE VERY HAPPY ABOUT THAT UH
OKAY SO THE PRINTER THAT'S THAT'S NOT THE S NOT THE HARD CONSTRAINT BUT UH
MM-HMM
UH REMEMBER ANDREI THAT WAS UH YEAH YEAH
YEAH THAT WAS THE CASE AND UH SHE WAS A BIT UH RELUCTANT BUT
YEAH MM
'CAUSE I REALLY DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE
WHERE YEAH YOU CAN CLOSE IT YOU HAVE THE PERSONAL FILES OF THE OF THE PEOPLE OF THE OF THE OF THE UNIT ETCETERA ETCETERA
AN ADMIN ROOM CLEARLY IDENTIFIED AS AN ADMIN ROOM AND ONLY AN ADMIN ROOM WHERE YOU HAVE FILES
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH WE COULD STORE FILES THERE AND THINGS LIKE THAT
OKAY SO IF YOU WANT I CAN ALREADY DO THIS CHANGE HERE
SO FOR INSTANCE I BE FULLY AGAINST THE FACT THAT MY PERSONAL FILES ARE IN F IN A IN A ROOM THAT IS NOT SPECIFICALLY DEDICATED FOR THAT
BECAUSE THE PROFESSORS UH YOU HAVE PERSONAL PRINTER OR THERE IS ONLY ONE PRINTER
SORRY YOU'RE
UM
BECAUSE IF NOT THE PERSON THE PRINTER CAN GO IN A ROOM OF THREE PEOPLE
THAT'S TYPICAL OF CASE WHERE THERE'S THE LAB AND THERE'S THE PRINTER IS THERE
MM-HMM
THAT'S UH THAT'S UH THAT'S PERFECTLY ALRIGHT
PRINTER CAN BE IN THE IN THE IN THE CORRIDOR
YEAH TH YEAH TH WHEN THE PRINTER IS YEAH IT'S IT'S THE MAIN ONE
WE HAVE A SECONDARY ONE WHICH WE COULD TRY TO ACCOMMODATE IN ANOTHER ROOM BUT IT'S BASICALLY YEAH THE PEOP THE THE PRINTER WHERE EVERYBODY PRINTS
UM SO I CHANGE THIS
SO MAYBE I WOULD SUGGEST LET ME LE K CAN I HEAR ALSO LET US HEAR FROM YOU
AND IF NOT UM WE'LL JUST WELL START FROM SCRATCH
UM
AND THEN IF WE CAN WORK OUT A SOLU A COMMON SOLUTION FROM THIS ONE THEN WE GO BACK TO TO THIS SLIDE
I'M PERFECTLY ALRIGHT TO SHARE THE ROOM WITH YOU HAS A VIEW ON THE OLD TOWN
THAT'S UM
MM-HMM
OKAY
YOU HAVE TO BE AWARE OF WHAT I WAS SAYING LAST TIME WAS THAT YOU HAVE TO SUFFER SOME SUFFER FROM FRO FROM PHONE CALLS
YEAH
LOT'S OF PHONE CALLS
YEAH
YEAH I'LL TRY
I'LL BRING MY WALKMAN AND UH
SO IF YOU HAVE A WALKMAN THAT'S THAT'S GOOD
EARPLUGS UH WHATEVER
UH DAVID YOU HAD ALSO UH WHAT'S
YEAH
YEAH OKAY FOR ME UH AS UH I DON'T KNOW L UH THE PEOPLE A LOT
I WOULD TRY TO SHARE THEM WITH THE WOMEN SO UH FOR EXAMPLE IN YOUR SLIDE I COULD UH SWITCH EITHER YOU OR MARTIN WITH UH UH THE OTHER ROOM
THIS ONE
UH YOU SUGGESTED THAT UH THERE'S A LA A LACK OF MEN S SO I WOULD RE CERTAINLY PUT UH NOT TWO MEN IN THE SAME OFFICE
AH
UH-HUH
OH LET ME PUT THE PLAN SORRY
SO SO YOU WOULD PUT UH
I DON'T WANT TO INFLUENCE YOU
I WILL DISPLAY UH YEAH THIS IS THE EMPTY ONE
SO
YES PLEASE
SO YEAH YOU HAVE TO SHOW US WHICH ONE YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT DAVID WE DIDN'T
YEAH
YEAH YEAH I WAS WANTING TO CHANGE THIS WA
YEAH
AH THE CENTRE ROOM
MM-HMM
YOU CAN YOU CAN EVEN STAND AND JUST SHOW US THERE
MM-HMM
YEAH BUT I NEED YOUR UH YOUR SLIDE BECAUSE I WAS TALKING ABOUT YOUR SLIDE
OKAY I I DON'T WANT TO INFLUENCE YOU TOO MUCH BUT UH MM I'M PERFECTLY HAPPY TO START WITH THIS AS THE BASIS AND THEN CHANGE THINGS
OKAY SO WE WOULD PREFER THE NAMES
YEAH BECAUSE THERE ARE PLENTY OF THINGS THAT ARE THAT ARE OKAY SO UH
YES SO HERE YOU CAN SEE THAT THE THE THE MEN IS I MEAN THEY ARE ALWAYS SH SHARING THE ROOM WITH A G WITH A WOMAN
I MEAN THERE'S BRUNO ME UH PIERRETTE AND NIKOS IS A GUY ALSO
YEAH MAYBE IN DIFFERENT JUST
UH-HUH
OH
YEAH BUT FOR PIERRETTE AN AND MAGGIE IT'S UH IT'S
IT'S A WISH OR IT'S UH IT'S BECAUSE THEY
YEAH IT'S THE FEMININE OF PIERRE
MM-HMM
OR ACTUALLY PIERRETTE IS A WOMAN TOO
SORRY FOR THIS
OH
SO I MEAN THIS IS PERFECTLY FINE I WILL JUST SEND MARTIN AND ANDREI FOR MARIA OR OR YALINA OR NANCY MAYBE
MM-HMM
SO
I DIDN'T GET YOUR SOLUTION
WHAT WAS IT AGAIN
SO I WOULD CHANGE ONE SWITCH ONE
I IT'S NICE
I DON'T THINK I MEAN THERE'S A LACK OF MEN HERE IN IN IN THIS IN THIS LAB
YEAH HERE THERE ARE TWO MEN
SO I MEA YEAH
SO
UH HE WANTS TO MIX SEXES
UH-HUH
AH OKAY
BAD
YEAH
BUT THAT'S NOT SO MUCH A QUESTION OF UH MEN OR WOMEN IT'S MORE THE QUESTION OF AS I SAID THAT'S UH
THERE YOU HAVE S SENIOR RESEARCHERS THAT ARE A GROUP WHICH IS TO ME MORE
UM HERE YOU HAVE ONLY P. YOU HAVE P. H. D. STUDENTS THAT ARE A GROUP
MM-HMM
UNLESS IT CORRESPONDS TO SOME SPECIFIC DEMAND LIKE IT IS IN THE CASE IN MAGGIE MAGGIE'S CASE AND PIERRETTE'S CASE
I THINK THAT'S A VERY EFFICIENT WAY OF DOING THINGS BECAUSE
YEAH
MM-HMM
OKAY SO LET'S KEEP IN MIND MAYBE THIS UH CONSTRAINT OF BALANCING THE THE GENDERS UH WE'LL SEE IF WE CAN UH DO SOMETHING FOR IT
YEAH AND FOR ME IT'S ALSO UH I WOULD PREFER MAYBE NOT TO BE IN A THREE PERSON OFFICE JUST TO BE A BIT CALMER
BUT I COULD ALSO BE HAPPY WITH MOST OF THE OTHER PEOPLE SO EVEN IN A THREE PERSON ROOM
AND MARTIN SO I'M VERY HAPPY WITH YOU SINCE I PROPOSED IT
IT'S IT'S FINE
YEAH MM I'M PERFECTLY HAPPY WITH WITH ANDREI SO
SURE BUT UM
ANDREI DID YOU ASK THESE PEOPLE IF THIS WAS OKAY WITH THEM
UM YEAH MARIA AND YALINA SEEM UH TO GO ON ONE QUITE QUITE WELL
MARIANNE UH UH THE FINNISH MARIANNE AND UH NIKOS WHO INTERACT QUITE A LOT ON UH ON
UH I'VE ASKED SOME OF THEM AND I'VE ALSO USED A LITTLE BIT UH WHAT I'VE WELL
I MEAN THE THE PRESENT ARRANGEMENT JUST NOT TO TO SHOCK PEOPLE TOO MUCH
AND IT'S ALSO PEOPLE THAT I KNOW UM GET ON WELL QUITE QUITE WELL TOGETHER AND ALSO WORK ON THE SAME PROJECT LIKE FOR INSTANCE
UM YEAH SO I THINK WELL AT LEAST AS FAR AS I I ASKED THERE WAS NO MAJOR OBJECTION
UH NANCY HAD NO STRONG PREFERENCE SPECIALLY SINCE SHE'S NO LONGER ALLOWED TO SMOKE IN IN HER OFFICE
BUT ISN'T THERE JUST A A A QUESTION OF PROXIMITY YOU PUT DAVID WITH AGNES
UM BUT ISN'T AGNES WORKING
UM IN A IN A MORE SUBSTANTIAL WAY IN UH WITH PEOPLE LIKE UH EITHER MARIA OR YALINA
UM
THAT'S TRUE
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
I UM SO WE COULD PUT NANCY WITH DAVID AND UH PUT AGNES YEAH
YES
'CAUSE
YEAH BUT AGNES IS ALSO WORKING WITH DAVID SO
BUT WE AGREE THAT IT'S NOT IMPORTANT TO TO SHARE THE ROOM WITH SOMEONE THAT HAS THE SAME PROJECT
YEAH YEAH I I KNOW
MM-HMM
NO THAT'S TRUE THAT'S TRUE
THE OTHER CONSTRAINTS ARE ARE SATISFIED SOMEHOW SO
MM-HMM
QUITE HAPPY TO HAVE THE THE FULL ROOM SOME FIFTY PER CENT OF THE TIME
UM
YEAH THAT'S A SMALL ADVANTAGE AND UH I IT'S A BIT MORE UH MORE COMFORTABLE ACTUALLY
NO THAT'S NOT COMPLETELY EQUIVALENT BECAUSE NANCY ALL ARE P. H. D. STUDENTS OR MASTERS STUDENTS BUT NANCY
CORRECT
NO BUT WHAT I MEAN IT WAS WAS THE THREE THE TWO THREE PERSON ROOMS I THINK THAT THEY CAN MIX THEM THE WAY THEY WANT
I MEAN IF THEY PREFER TO BE UH MARIA THA UH YALINA AND NIKOS AND NANCY AND MARIANNE ON THE OTHER SIDE WELL
YEAH BUT THERE'S
MM-HMM
YEAH BUT THAT DOESN'T MAT THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT
OH
SO THAT WAY THEN
THAT WOULDN'T IT MAYBE BE BETTER TO PUT DAVID IN SINCE HE'S ONLY HALF TIME
THERE W ONE QUESTION I WAS WONDERING ABOUT THOUGH 'CAUSE THREE IS ALWAYS UH WELL THE MORE PEOPLE IN A OFFICE UH THE LESS IDEAL
YEAH MAYBE
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
VERY GOOD
YEAH
THERE'S NOT THREE PEOPLE ALL THE TIME
YEAH
SO I WOULD SWITCH DAVID AND NANCY TYPICALLY
YEAH PROBABLY
MM-HMM
BUT I DEFINITELY WOULD PUT UH NANCY WITH AGNES IN THE TWO PERSON ROOM
WHICH DOESN'T MEAN THAT DAVID SHOULD BE IN THIS ROOM
FOR ME UH THE TWO THREE PEOPLE ROOMS ARE REALLY THEY HAVE TO BE UH RE SHUFFLED ACCORDING TO PEOPLE PERSONAL PREFERENCES
HE COULD BE IN THE OTHER ONE
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
SO AGNES HAS WORKED
MM-HMM
UM AT YEAH I MEAN
THEY THEY HAVE WORKED TOGETHER ON SO THIS MAKES SOME SENSE
YEAH
BUT AGAIN IT'S ALSO A QUESTION OF PERSONAL PREFERENCE
I MEAN YOU YOU CAN'T BE IN A ROOM WITH PERSON YOU DON'T WANT TO BE WITH
YEAH AS FAR AS I KNOW I THINK IT'S PROBABLY QUITE A GOOD UH UH GOOD MATCH
IS THERE ANYONE THAT IS GOING TO FINISH P. H. D. OR OR LEAVE OR
UH NO
UH MARIA IS MARIA IS THE CLOSEST BUT SHE'S STILL NOT UH UH YEAH
FIRST ONE SHOULD BE MARIA BUT IT'S STILL UH ONE AND A HALF
OKAY LET'S SWITCH UH
KNOWING THAT THIS ONE FREE POSITION UH WILL NOT STAY FREE VERY LONG
I SEE IF YOU DO IT THIS WAY
BECAUSE DAVID WILL BE PART TIME AND THE OTHER ONE NOT SO OVERLOADED BECAUSE THERE IS UH ONE FREE POSITION UH
YOU MEAN THAT IN THE TWO THREE PEOPLE ROOM THERE WILL BE ONE THAT IS NOT SO OVERLOADED BECAUSE OF DAVID
MM-HMM YEAH
NO BECAUSE DON'T FORGET WE ALREADY HAVE SOMEBODY COMING IN UH JANUARY
YES SO
MM-HMM
AT LEAST ONE PERSON
I'LL JUST UH
AND THIS IS STILL A WORRY FOR ME BECAUSE WE ARE STILL WE DON'T STILL STILL DON'T HAVE ENOUGH SPACE FOR THE VISITORS
UNLESS WE PUT THEM IN THE LOUNGE
YEAH
MM YEAH I I DON'T THINK
OR WE MAKE FOUR SPACE IN THE THREE PEOPLE ROOOM
YEAH
THEREFORE I W
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH SO S S OKAY SO SINCE WE ARE SUPPOSED TO DO A FINAL PROPOSAL
SORRY UH LET ME MOVE THE PRINTER UM NEXT TO THE PHOTOCOPIER
WE NEED TO HAVE AT LEAST THREE VISITORS' POSITION BECAUSE POSITIONS BECAUSE
OUTSIDE
YEAH
YEAH
AND WE'LL FIND SOME WAY TO UM WELL ATTACH IT TO A WALL OR SOMETHING LIKE THIS
OKAY
SO THAT WE KEEP IT YOU MEAN
UH I DON'T THINK WE CAN PUT VISITORS IN THE LOUNGE IT'S UH
UM OKAY SO THAT'S THE UH MM-HMM
YEAH I THINK SO YEAH
NO
IF IT'S THOUGHT AS THE QUE THAT THAT'S REALLY A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION TO ME
WE CAN READ NEWSPAPERS ELSEWHERE
DO WE DO WE PUT PRIORITY ON THE FACT OF BEING ABLE TO READ NEWSPAPERS IN OUR IN OUR OFFICES OR IN OUR UH WORK PLACE
IT DEPENDS IT DEPENDS ON HOW WE THINK ABOUT THE LOUNGE
IF IT'S THOUGHT AS BEING A READING ROOM
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
YOU CAN GO ON THE BALCONY IF IT'S IF IT'S IN THE SUMMER
KNOW WE CAN GO TO THE CAFETERIA OR YOU CAN SIT SOMEWHERE ELSE
THAT'S JUST NOT NOT ACCORDING TO MY PRIORITIES
SO I I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE WHY WE SHOULD PUT PRIORITY ON LOUNGES IF WE IF WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH SPACE FOR ACCOMMODATING VISITORS
NEWSPAPERS YOU CAN READ THEM HOME
AND I REALLY DO THINK IT'S MORE IMPORTANT FOR LAB TO BE ABLE TO DECENTLY UH WELCOME VISITORS THAT COME TO THE LAB THAN TO HAVE A PLACE FOR READING NEWSPAPERS
YEAH
IT'S
MM-HMM
HOW
SUSAN YOU ARE VERY HAPPY WITH THIS SOLUTION SO OKAY
HOW WOULD IT BE TO PUT THE LOUNGE IN ONE OF THE SMALLER OFFICES
LIKE IN WELL IN IN ONE OF THE ONE PERSON OFFICES
IN GISELL
W I I KNOW THEY ARE ACTUALLY QUITE UH QUITE DEMANDED SO UM I TH I THINK
YES YES
S SO LET'S LET'S PUT THE LOUNGE IN SUSAN'S OFFICE AND SUSAN'S IN SUSAN IN THE LOUNGE WITH THREE VISITORS MM
THAT'S AN EXCELLENT IDEA
NO BUT A LOUNGE IN A ONE PERSON ROOM IS REALLY TOO SMALL
MM
YEAH IT'S PROBABLY TOO SMALL
OKAY YEAH DOESN'T WORK
IT'S TOO SMALL FOR A UH YEAH
WE IT'S A LUXURY FOR US
I WOULD ADVOCATE TO JUST REMOVE THE LOUNGE
I MEAN WE ARE RESEARCHERS
THAT'S JUST NOT THAT'S JUST NOT REALISTIC
WE DON'T HAVE SPACE FOR A LOUNGE
I PREFER TO READ MY NEWSPAPER
IT'S LET'S BE YOU YOU CANNOT YOU CANNOT GO AT THE AT THE AT THE AT THE IN FRONT OF YOUR COLLEAGUES AND SAYING
I P IF I HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN UH READING MY NEWSPAPER AND DISC AND HAVING A A DECENTLY WELCOMED UH V UH RESEARCH VISITOR
MM-HMM
OKAY LET'S BE INNOVATIVE
UM
BUT THE PROBLEM IS IT IT HAS BEEN DECIDED BY EVERYONE AND APPROVED BY THE SCHOOL THAT WE WE NEED THE LOUNGE SO I I THINK IT'S SIMPLY NOT
MM-HMM
NO NO I DON'T THINK WE CAN CHOOSE
MM-HMM
NO ACTUALLY UH I I'M SORRY IT'S UH YEAH
BUT THEN
AND AT LEAST WE HAVE SOME UH FREE MARGIN FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS OR THE NEXT YEAR
THEN YOU HAVE THE THREE PEOPLE ROOM THAT POSITIONS
SPLIT IT IN TWO PARTS AS AS SUSAN WAS WAS UH PROPOSING LAST TIME WAS A HA WAS A WALL AND YOU HAVE A LOUNGE THERE CAN READ YOUR NEWSPAPERS AND WE HAVE A FULL TWO ROOM TWO PERSON ROOM WHERE WE CAN CERTAINLY ACCOMMODATE THREE VISITORS
OH
OKAY SO SO HOW DO WE SPLIT THE ROOM
THE THE THREE PEOPLE OVER THERE
WE PUT IT THE THE FURNITURE THAT WE GOT FOR OUR READING ROOM WE PUT IT INTO THE OTHER HALF OF THE THREE PERSON ROOM
THIS ONE
UH-HUH
YEAH
AND PUT UH UH MM
MM-HMM
SO
WOULD THAT FIT
A LITTLE DIVIDER OF SOME KIND
BUT WHAT ABOUT IF PEOPLE WANT TO HAVE A SMALL DISCUSSION IN THE LOUNGE
YEAH
THEY ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE A DISCUSSION IN THE LOUNGE THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO READ THEIR NEWSPAPERS
AND TO DRINK THEIR COFFEE
WELL NOT THE NEWSPAPERS BECAUSE NO SCIENTIFIC ARTICLES
WELL NOT JUST NEWSPAPERS
THE THE GOAL OF THE LOUNGE WAS WAS A PLACE WHERE YOU CAN RELAX
UH SCIENTIFIC ARTICLES
NO THAT'S NOT THAT WASN'T THE GOAL
JOURNALS
YEAH
UH-HUH
BUT ALSO TO READ ARTICLES
YOU CAN DO IT IN YOUR OFFICE
SO YOU WOULD LIKE TO PUT IT YEAH WITHIN YEAH AND THEN WHO WHO YEAH
IT'S IT'S IT'S YOU HAVE A GOOD CHAIRS TO READ NEWSPAPERS THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO BREAK YOU HEART YOUR YOUR YOUR YOUR BACK YOUR OFFICE
BUT THAT MEANS THE OFFICE WILL BE AT LEAST FOR THE MOMENT EMPTY
AND UH HERE WE'LL PUT TWO PLACES FOR VISITORS
THREE
YEAH OKAY BUT THEN THAT MEANS THAT WE'LL PUT THE LOUNGE ON THE RIGHT SIDE UH HERE
THAT LOOKS VERY BAD
YEAH
YES
MM-HMM
YES
THREE
NO WE HAVE OUR VISITOR THAT IS ARRIVING
UH WHAT DID YOU SAY SUSAN
IT'S NOT A VISITOR
IT'S A A NEW P P FULL TIME PERSON ARRIVING IN JANUARY
UH OKAY
OKAY SO THAT COULD TAKE THE THE FREE PLACE OVER THERE
UH I MEAN
NO THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GONNA PUT THE LOUNGE
NO NO
THAT COULD TAKE ONE ONE POSITIONS IN THE IN THE LO IN THE
NO
LET'S PUT M MARIA OR YALINA IN THE IN THE IN THIS PLACE
YEAH I THINK OKAY SO WE NEED WHAT TWO THREE POSITIONS AND ONE NEW PERSON ARRIVING X. OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
THAT MEANS THAT WE HAVE ONE PERSON THERE WITH ONE FREE POSITION
IF IF IF IF YOU FORGET ABOUT THE LOUNGE
AH OKAY THAT THAT'S AN IDEA
WHAT YOU COULD DO IS TO MOVE EITHER MARI MARIA OR YALINA IN THE IN THE MM WHAT IS CURRENTLY THE LOUNGE
WELL FOR
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
SO WE HAVE THREE POSITION DISTRIBUTED OVER THE ROOMS WHERE WE CAN ACCOMMODATE
WE HAVE ONE FREE POSITION IN THE IN THE ROOM THAT MARIA OR YALINA IS COMING FROM AND ONE FREE POSITION OVER THERE
MM-HMM
AND AND WHERE IS THE LOUNGE
NO LOUNGE
NO LOUNGE
NO NO NO NO WE WE HAVE TO
I'LL I'LL HAVE MY HEAD CUT OFF IF WE DON'T HAVE A LOUNGE
SO UH
NO OKAY NO WAY
LOUGE
YOU TAKE THE FURNITURE OF THE LOUNGE AND YOU PUT IT IN THE CORRIDOR
YEAH YEAH YEAH
NO THERE'S NO SPACE
THE LOUNGE IS IN THE FREE SPACE
I MEAN OTHERWISE I CANNOT REALLY DEFEND IT BECAUSE IT IT WAS AGREED AND WE CANNOT JUST COME BACK ON EVERY EVERY DECISION WE MADE
NO NO NO NO LET'S DO THE LOUNGE CORNER
AT LEAST
OKAY
AFTER ALL THAT WE WENT THROUGH TO GET THE BUDGET FOR IT WE REALLY HAVE TO UH
YEAH I THINK SO YEAH
YOU YOU WILL EXPLAIN TO YOUR VISITORS THAT UNFORTUNATELY THEY HAVE A POSITION IN THE TOILET BECAUSE THERE IS A READING ROOM WHERE PEOPLE HAVE TO RELAX
OKAY
NO WAIT A MINUTE YEAH
OKAY SO WHAT WE NEED IS A NEW AND TWO
WELL LET'S HAVE THE VISITORS FIRST
SO
I DON'T WANT TO SEPARATE THEM REALLY BUT UH
I THINK WE CAN PUT WHAT MARIA OR YALINA
UM SO I WAS THINKING TO PUT HERE
OH
MYSEL I DON'T LIKE THAT OFFICE ACTUALLY
COULD PUT YOU CAN SWITCH
IT COULD BE NIKOS FOR INSTANCE
YEAH
NO WE ARE NOT GONNA KEEP MARIANNE IN A THREE UH PERSON PLACE UH JUST HAVING MARIANNE IN THE LOUNGE
BUT IT'S A LOUNGE
YEAH NOW
SO IT'S EITHER
UH LET'S TRY MARIA HERE
OH YOU DON'T MIND
Y WE COULD PUT THE VISITOR WITH YOU MARTIN BUT IT'S PROBABLY OKAY LET'S TRY LE LET'S TRY THIS
YEAH BUT THEN
YEAH YOU COULD YOU COULD PUT ME THERE
I MEAN ANDREI
BECAUSE I WILL BE THERE HALF TIME AND THE VISITORS PROBABLY WILL NOT SO MUCH COMPLAIN ABOUT PHONE CALLS
PERFECT
BUT WAIT A MINUTE THEN ANDREI HAS A TWO PERSON OFFICE ALL FOR HIMSELF
NO NO WE'LL PUT A VISITOR PLACE IN THERE
IF YOU DON'T MIND
WELL THERE IS THIS FULL TIME PERSON ARRIVING IN I I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO TO PLAN WITH THAT
YEAH
WHA WHAT'S WHAT'S HER NAME AGAIN ANDREI
UH I THINK IT'S PAOLA
PAOLA
YEAH
UM
WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO HAVE PAOLA IN YOUR OFFICE
YEAH COULD BE
EITHER YOU WANT TO KEEP ME IN YOUR OFFICE WHICH IS ALRIGHT AND THEN WE HAVE TO FORSEE A PLACE FOR PAOLA SOMEWHERE
'CAUSE THAT'S THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WE SHOULD BE DECIDING
I I THINK THAT'S THAT'S NOT REALISTIC TO HAVE A PLANNING
IF
YEAH
MM-HMM
NO I I WOULD PREFER YOU I THINK
OKAY LET ME KEEP YOU
OKAY
MARTIN GOES BACK TO ANDREI
OKAY WE'LL PUT PAOLA AND A VISITOR HERE
WHY DIDN
SO PAOLA IS THE NEW PERSON
YEAH
AND THEN WE'LL WE'LL STILL HAVE PROBABLY SOME WAY TO PUT A SECOND VISITOR HERE
IS THAT VIS ONE
AND A VISITOR UH VIS
VIS TWO
THAT'S VISITOR ONE
OOPS
SORRY IT'S NOT VERY NICE BUT
MM
DOES THIS DISPLAY BETTER
UM PAOLA WELL PAOLA BEING NEW I I THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER TO PUT HER WITH SOMEBODY ELSE
I THINK IT'S NOT BAD
UH-HUH
YEAH DON'T PUT HER ALONE
SOMEBODY ELSE
I MEAN YOU CANNOT GO THERE AND DISCUSS AND AND TWO PEOPLE WORKING THERE IN THE ROOM
WELL THE THE LOUNGE CAN NOT BE IN HERE T WITH TWO PEOPLE
YEAH
OKAY THEN MARTIN LET LET ME PUT YOU IN THAT OFFICE AND I'LL PUT PAOLA WITH ME
YOU KNOW COFFEE AT THE END OF THE DAY OR A DRINK THEN THE TWO PEOPLE WILL STOP WORKING
NO
I DON'T KNOW MAYBE THEY WON'T BE HAPPY
NO BUT WE SAID THAT WE WON'T DISCUSS OR MAYBE IF WE ORGANISE SOME KIND OF
YEAH
NOT SUPPOSED TO DISCUSS YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO RELAX
SURE NOT ME
NO NO PUT WHY NOT MARIA OR YALINA
SO MARTIN GOES WHERE
MARIA'S
MARTIN STAYS
YEAH
BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO SEPARATE MA MARIA AND YALINA
WHY
OKAY
IT'S A MASTER STUDENT SO UH
'CAUSE YALINA I IT'S NOT EVEN SURE SHE STAYS
YEAH OKAY
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
OKAY SO LET'S PUT MARIA IN THE SEPARATE OFFICE
YEAH
AND WE HAVE YEAH AND WE HAVE TWO VISITORS AND A MASTERS STUDENT AND A P AND A PART TIME PERSON
AND WE HAVE PAOLA
I WAS THINKING THE OTHER WAY AROUND
OH SORRY WHAT WERE YOU THINKING
TO KEEP PAOLA WITH MARIA IN THE TWO PEOPLE ROOM AND TO HAVE THIS ONE WITH TWO YALINA AND DAVID IN THE THREE PEOPLE ROOM
SO WHO IS WITH MARIA HERE
OKAY
PAOLA
AND NO VISITOR
YEAH
NO THAT'S A TWO PEOPLE ROOM SO
YEAH BUT THAT MEANS THAT THIS ROOM THE MIDDLE ONE WOULD BE QUITE EMPTY
ALL THE I MEAN TWO VISITORS AND THE FIFTY PER CENT PERS PERSON I DON'T THINK IT'S VERY UH REASONABLE
YEP
NO YALINA IS THERE DAVID IS THERE
BUT YOU NEED TO HAVE TO PUT VISITORS SOMEWHERE I MEAN UH
WELL WE HAVE
UH YEAH
YEAH BUT LET'S SPLIT THEM A LITTLE BIT SO THAT WHEN THERE ARE NO VISITORS AT LEAST PEOPLE ARE
AH
OTERWISE WE MIGHT UH LOSE ROOM OR TWO
NO THE ROOMS HAVE TO LOOK LIKE THEY'RE SORT OF OCCUPIED UH
YEAH I THINK SO
OH
OKAY
PAOLA IS THERE
AND IS THIS BETTER
SO THIS GOES HERE GOES VISITOR TWO
HERE GOES VISITOR ONE
THAT'S TRUE
THIS IS ALWAYS THE GAME
EXCEPT THAT WE CANNOT READ IT BUT
APART FROM THIS
WELL
IT'S A LITTLE BIT CROWDED IN
YOU WILL HAVE TWO FULL TIME PERSON PLUS ONE PART TIME PERSON PLUS ONE VISITOR THAT'S
'CAUSE YOU HAVE WELL NOT YET OF COURSE BECAUSE PAOLA IS NOT HAS NOT ARRIVED BUT UH STARTING FROM JANUARY
MM-HMM
LET ME CALL THIS VISITOR ONE WHICH IMPLIES THAT UH IT WILL BE THE FIRST ONE OCCUPIED BY A VISITOR WHEN THEY COME
AND THIS VISITOR TWO WHICH MEANS IT'S LIKE A WELL YOU KNOW SECOND UH SECOND CHANCE
YEAH OKAY
'KAY
OKAY
BUT WHY COULDN'T WE BASICALLY
MOVE YOU DAVID IN THIS TWO PEOPLE ROOM WITH MARIA
OR WE COULD
WHAT WOULD THIS CHANGE
MARIA PLUS ONE HALF PA UH HALF TIME PERSON
MM-HMM
ON ON THE ON THE LONG TERM DISAPPEAR BECAUSE ANYHOW I DON'T BELIEVE THERE CAN BE A LOUNGE WHERE IN A PLACE WHERE THERE ARE ALREADY TWO PEOPLE WORKING
AND YOU HAVE PAOLA YALINA ONE VISITOR POSITION AND I STILL KEEP HOPE THAT UH MARIANNE NIKOS THAT THE LOUNGE WILL ON THE
SO THE LOUNGE WILL JUST DIE AFTER SOME POINT AND IT UH IT
NO BUT BUT LOOK MARTIN IT'S QUITE A LONG ROOM IT HAS TWO DOORS
STILL I MEAN
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
AH OKAY AH IT HAS TWO DOORS
OH YEAH VERY GOOD
YEAH SO MAYBE IN THE LONG RUN WE'LL GET A WALL
OKAY THAT'S TRUE
'KAY THEN THEN THERE WILL BE A WALL
OKAY
AH YEAH BUT THEN THEN YEAH OKAY OKAY
UH-HUH
UM
DO YOU HAVE ANY PREFERENCES DAVID
AL ALTHOUGH THERE ARE THREE WINDOWS BUT UM OKAY
SO WHERE WOULD WE MOVE DAVID TO MARIA DA WITH MARIA
YEAH THAT'S GOOD
UH IT'S COMPLETELY FINE
YEAH RIGHT
UH SHE SHE WA SHE WANTS MIXING PEO UH MEN AND WOMEN SO OR SHE HE
SO YEAH
WELL HE ALREADY IS MIXED
UH WE'LL SEE
THEN UH THE TWO VISITORS WILL BE IN ONE ROOM BUT DOESN'T THAT'S FINE BECAUSE MAYBE THERE ARE NOT TWO VISITORS AT THE SAME TIME
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S TO ME IT'S MORE REALISTIC
AND WHEN THERE ARE TWO PEOPLE SO IT MAKES TOO MANY VARIATIONS BUT
YEAH I WOULDN'T PUT THE TWO VISITORS IN THE SAME ROOM BECAUSE WHEN THERE IS NO ONE IT MAKES A BIG HOLE
YEAH BUT THEN THEN YOU CAN YOU CAN MOVE FOR INSTANCE IF YOU MOVE DAVID TO UH WITH MARIA
YEAH
MM-HMM
THEN
YEAH THE OCCUPANCY IS BETTER THAT WAY
I THINK IT'S IT'S BETTER
FIRST IT'S BETTER
I THINK IT'S UH BECAUSE IT'S MORE IT'S STABLER
YOU PREFER THAT TOO SUSAN
OKAY
BECAUSE THERE IS REGULAR THERE IS REGULAR OCCUPANCY YEAH
'CAUSE VISITORS STAY AND GO
OKAY
UH WHAT DID WE SAY HERE
THIS ONE
OOPS
SORRY
ONE
YEAH THAT'S GOOD
YEAH MY UH
TO ME THAT'S THE BEST WE CAN DO
IF YOU IF WE REALISTICALLY CAN PLAN TO HAVE A LOUNGE
OKAY
WELL I THINK THAT WAS REALLY DECIDED AND IT'S IT'S NO WE NO BECAUSE
ACTUALLY IF WE DO A PROPOSAL WITHOUT A LOUNGE AND YOU KNOW THE OTHER GROUP WILL
OKAY OKAY OKAY
WE WON'T BE VERY CREDIBLE
I GO I GOT THE MESSAGE
YEAH EXACTLY AND THAT MEANS THAT ALL THE CONSTRAINTS THAT WE SAID AND UH ALL THE OTHER THINGS JUST WE WE WELL JUST BASICALLY DISAPPEAR
YES SIR
UH-HUH WHICH MEANS WE'VE WORKED FOR NOTHING
UH WHAT'S WHAT'S WRONG WITH THIS
OKAY
SO WHO HAS STRONG
OKAY
STRONG OPPOSITION TO THAT
UH I DON'T
OH YOU HAVE TO GO SUSAN
OKAY
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK
BUT DO YOU HAVE ANY NO
YEAH PLEASE
YEAH WELL WE ARE ALMOST DONE SUSAN BUT UH WE WE'LL WE'LL JUST CHECK THE THE ITEMS
OKAY
NO PROBLEM
I I JUST NEED TO SEE SOMEBODY
NO YOU JUST HAVE
BUT IT'S JUST A DECISION
YEAH WE WE'LL JUST REVIEW THE ITEMS TO SEE IS WE LOOK AT ALL THE CONSTRAINTS AND THEN YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SAY THE FINAL UH YES OR NO
UM
OKAY
'CAUSE UH WE ARE SURE THAT MAGGIE AND BRUNO UH MAGGIE IS HAPPY WITH HAVING BRUNO IN HER OFFICE AND PIERRETTE IS HAPPY TO HAVE UH MARIANNE IN HER OFFICE
I THINK WE WE WE ACCOMMODATED MOST OF THE CONSTRAINTS
THAT'S THAT THAT CHECKED
OKAY
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH I THINK THAT'S OKAY
YEAH WE CHECKED
UH
AND YES AND NO REASON TO THINK THAT THERE SHOULD BE UH UH UH UH AN IMPOSSIBLE SITUATION
I DON'T THINK SO
NO
SAME THING FOR MARIANNE AND MARIANNE F. AND NIKOS
MM-HMM
AND UH WELL YALINA AHA THAT MEANS FOR A FOR A SHORT TIME YALINA WILL BE JUST ALONE IN THE THREE PERSON ROOM
UH PAOLA WE DON'T KNOW YET BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T ARRIVED YET
YEAH THAT'S A BIT YEAH THAT WAS THE POINT IN LETTING DAVID THERE AND BUT OKAY MAYBE WE'LL JUST LEAVE IT AS AN OPTION
DAVID OR VISITOR ONE OR TWO
IT'S UH
THAT'S A BIT A PROBLEM
UH AS LONG AS PAOLA IS NOT HAS NOT ARRIVED IS TO SWITCH FOR THE PROPOSAL PAOLA AND DAVID
AH BUT THEN THEN WE WHAT WE COULD JUST FOR THE SAKE OF HAVING A DEFENDABLE SOLUTION
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
BUT WE WE REALLY PLAN THAT AS SOON AS PAOLA IS HERE OR EVEN EARLIER
MM-HMM
YEAH
OKAY
SO WE'LL KNOW THAT UH THAT THE REGION ACTUALLY AROUND HERE IS PROBABLY MOVABLE
YEAH
YEAH EITHER YEAH WE CAN SWITCH MARIA OR PAOLA OR DAVID
DAVID WILL GO TO THE TO THE TWO PEOPLE ROOM
IT'S JUST IT WILL BE SWITCHED
OKAY
'CAUSE THIS THIS THIS THIS IS DANGEROUS TO PROPOSE
I MEAN YOU HAVE A THREE PER THREE PERSON ROOM WITH ONE MASTERS STUDENT IN IT
SO I WOULDN'T I WOULDN'T PROPOSE THAT
MM-HMM
BUT OKAY WE'LL UH WE'LL BE OPEN ON ON THAT POINT
YEAH THA THA YEAH THAT'S WHY I ALWAYS TRY TO PUT THE TO SEPARATE THE VISITORS JUST TO BALANCE A LITTLE BIT
YEAH NO EXACTLY
OKAY
BUT AS SOON AS PAOLA IS HERE
UH IT STARTS TO BE BETTER
AND WE WILL HAVE VISITORS FOR SURE
YEAH IT WILL BECOME
OR IT DEPENDS ALSO ON WELL IF YALINA STAYS LONGER OR NOT WHICH IS NOT YET VERY CLEAR BUT UM
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH RIGHT RIGHT THAT'S TRUE
AH DO WE HAVE A DO DO WE KNOW DO WE KNOW WHEN WHEN IS SHE SUPPOSED TO FINISH THE HER UH MASTER THESIS
OH YEAH THAT'S A POINT TRUE
IN JUNE
ANYWAY WE'LL WE'LL BE OPEN
OKAY W WE'LL SEE
YEAH
MM I DON'T REALLY KNOW I THINK HER MASTER THESIS IS PROBABLY DUE UM NO I WOULD SAY YEAH MAYBE JUNE NEXT YEAR
AT THE LATEST
ACTUALLY I DON'T KNOW UNFORTUNATELY
JUNE NEXT YEAR
OKAY WHA WHEN WHEN DO WE WHEN DO YOU WHEN WHE UH WHEN ARE WE SUPPOSED TO SUB SUMBIT THE PROPOSAL
SO YEAH THIS ONE HAS TO TO BE THE THE FINAL ONE
I THINK IT'S EVEN UH A BIT LATER OR IN TWO DAYS OR SOMETHING LIKE THIS
WELL WE WE WON'T HAVE ANY EXTRA MEETING WELL THE FOUR OF US
WELL WITH THE OTHER I'LL COMPARE IT WITH THE OTHER ONE AND UH TRY TO MAKE A DECISION ACTUALLY
UM SO UM WE'LL WE'LL HAVE ACTUALLY I I'LL PRESENT THIS TO
'KAY THAT'S NOW
OKAY
MM
OKAY
WELL SO AS SOON AS WE HAVE SUSAN WE CAN UH WE CAN UM SO I WOULD I WOULD SWITCH AGAIN
AGAIN OKAY
MM-HMM
WE YEAH
DA BUT THAT AS I SAY IT'S JUST FOR THE SAKE OF THE OF THE PROPOSITION
SO I EVEN I'M EVEN READY TO UH TO INTERNALLY SAY THAT DAVID WILL ACTUALLY BE IN THIS ROOM
YEAH
W WE CAN LEAVE IT LIKE THIS AND THEN
NAMES ON THE DOORS
WHAT DOES IT WHAT DOES IT CHANGE
UH YEAH THERE WILL BE NAMES ON THE DOORS
AHA SO IF WE 'CAUSE SUSAN THE THE THE THE PROBLEM THE LET'S SAY THE TECHN NOT THE TECHNICAL
BUT CURRENTLY IF WE PRESENT IT AS IT IS WE HAVE A THREE PERSON ROOM THAT IS ONLY OCCUPIED BY A MASTERS STUDENT
THE PSY PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEM WE HAVE IS PRA I'M EXTREMENLY HAPPY WITH THAT SOLUTION
IT WOULD BE A WORKAB WORK WORKING SOLUTION STARTING FROM JANUARY WHEN PAOLA WILL BE HERE
SORRY YEAH
AND SHE'S JUST WORKING RIGHT NOW FOR UH
NO BECAUSE THERE IS ANOTHER PERSON RIGHT NOW A STUDENT THAT I JUST UH UM HIRED
AHA SO SH YOU HAVE A STUDENT
THAT WE THAT'S A REA REAL VISITOR TO SOME EXTENT
SO SHE'LL BE A VISITOR
FOR NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER YEAH
A SHE UH SHE'S A SHE'S A REAL VISITOR
YEAH
SHE'S A REAL VISITOR THAT I JUST MADE A CONTRACT FOR HER FOR TWO MONTHS
SO THEN WE WOULD HAVE TWO PEOPLE THERE
OKAY
AH SO THIS ONE AND THIS TWO ONE ARE JUST AH OKAY OKAY
MM-HMM
OKAY
I'LL TRY TO TO EXPRESS ALL THESE CONSTRAINTS AND UH AND SAY IN PARTICULAR THAT THE TWO ROOMS OVER HERE ACTUALLY ARE SORT OF UH
YEAH WE'LL WE'LL KEEP IT LIKE THIS
WELL S THINGS COULD BE CHANGED OVER THERE BUT ON SOME OTHER SIDES
UM OKAY I WELL
YEAH THEN THAT WORKS
I MEAN UH IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT IN THE RESEARCH DOMAIN THAT WE CAN HAVE PEOPLE COMING TO VISIT US
YEAH BUT YOU YOU REALLY HAVE ALSO TO SAY THAT THAT THAT A A UNIT HAS TO HAS TO HAVE SOME SOME HORIZON
YEAH THE VISITOR SPACE YEAH I'LL UH
MM-HMM
AND
YEAH UH THAT'S TRUE
UH THE SECOND POINT I WOULD SUGGEST IS THAT BEFORE YOU GO TO DEFEND IT
YOU SHOULD UH MM CIRCULATE IT UH OVER MAIL TO ALL THE ALL THE CON INVOLVED PEOPLE
WELL
TO DOUBLE CHECK SO THAT
I THINK THIS I I'M NOT VERY SURE BUT I THINK THIS WILL BE DONE AFTER THE MEETING WHEN OKAY
I WOULD DO IT BEFORE
UH WHAT DO YOU DO
AGNES COMES TO YOU OR PIERRETTE COMES TO YOU SAYING IT NO I DON'T WANT TO BE WITH MARIANNE
'CAUSE YOU IF YOU IF YOU SPEND TIME DEFENDING A THING THEN UM I DON'T KNOW
MM-HMM
YEAH
PERFECT
UH-HUH
A AS FAR AS KNOW I THINK AGNES IS ALSO TAKING CARE OF A PROPOSAL SO OKAY YEAH I'LL CIRCULATE THIS
SO SO IT DOESN'T
COST ANYTHING IT'S JUST PEOPLE WILL LOOK AT IT SAY OH GREAT
I HAVE A VIEW ON THE MOUNTAIN AND I'M UH WITH A PERSON I LIKE SO I'M HAPPY
YEAH EXACTLY
UM OKAY

UH TO DISCUSS AND COMPARE WITH THE OTHER PROPOSAL AND UH WELL MAKE A FINAL DECISION
UM YEAH ACTUALLY AS I AS I TOLD UH MARTIN UM WELL THIS IS THE LAST TIME WE MEET
ACTUALLY PROBABLY A PRE FINAL ONE SINCE WE'LL HAVE TO CHECK AGAIN WITH EVERYONE
OKAY SO MAYBE WE'LL LEARN SOME MORE CONSTRAINTS
SO UH THIS IS WELL MORE OR LESS OUR PROPOSAL
SO YOU HAVE A MEETING WHEN
WHAT'S THE TIMELINE ON THIS NOW
BECAUSE
WHEN I WILL HAVE THE OFFICE DECIDED THE PHONE NUMBER DECIDED
BECAUSE THESE ARE INFORMATION THAT I HAVE TO PROVIDE TO ADMINISTRATION
I'M REACHABLE WHEN I'M AT UH WELL THEY CAN PHONE ME ON THE MOBILE
YEAH IT'S IT'S IT'S NOT IT'S NOT COMPLETELY IT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE BECAUSE UH I NEED TO KNOW

MM-HMM
OH YEAH
MM-HMM

WELL FINDING OUT WHEN WE WILL MOVE AND THIS HAPPENS IN PROBABLY
WELL SO ACTUALLY I THINK I I'M NOT VERY SURE BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS

MM-HMM
YES YES
OKAY
WELL UH NETWORK CONNECTIONS I MEAN
AND THEN UH OF COURSE YOU HAVE THESE ALL THESE PRACTICAL ISSUES HOW ABOUT INTERNET CONNECTIONS

HOW MANY CONNECTIONS ARE THERE PER ROOM

BECAUSE WE JUST BOUGHT IT BUT UH ALL THE FURNITURE FROM THE PREVIOUS LOUNGE WE'LL WE'LL BRING IT HERE
WHAT WE'LL HAVE IS HAVE A BIT LESS FURNITURE IN THE LOUNGE AND THEN BRING ALL THE WELL THE OLD IT'S NOT OLD

HI
HI
HELLO
HELLO
HI EVERYONE
SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU ALL RECEIVED THE THE A AGENDA FOR THIS MEETING
DO YOU NO
NO I HAVEN'T
HERE IT IS
THANK YOU
I HAVEN'T
AS YOU KNOW UH SO IT'S FOR THE LAST FRIDAY OF THIS MONTH OF APRIL
SO UM UM THE GOAL FOR TODAY ARE UM WE HAVE TWO GOALS
AS YOU PROBABLY REMEMBER THE MOVIE ALREADY PROJECTED WERE UH LAWRENCE OF ARABIA AND APOCALYPSE NOW IN FEBRUARY AND AMADEUS FROM MILOS FORMAN IN MARCH
UH FIRST IS TO DECIDE A MOVIE FOR UH THE NEXT PROJECTION FOR OUR MOVIE CLUB
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
SO UM THE QUESTION THAT IS OPEN IS ARE WE GOING TO SELECT A MOVIE FROM THE NINETIES AND WHICH MOVIE
AND SECOND GOAL IS TO UH DISCUSS FOR AN AD ADVERTISING POSTER UM FOR OUR UM UH CLUB
BECAUSE WE NOTICED THAT N LAST TIME NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE CAME TO THE PROJECTION
SO THAT'S THE FIRST GOAL DECIDE FOR A MOVIE TO BE PROJECTED
SO THAT'S IT
UM WH WHO WANTS TO START TO
SO I GUESS YOU ALL PREPARED SOME DOCUMENTS FOR THE MM SELECTION OF MOVIE
YEAH
YEP
ACTUALLY MAYBE UM
YES
SO WHO WHO HAS WHAT
OKAY
UM I'VE GOT A POWERPOINT PRESENTATION
WHAT DO YOU HAVE MIREK
UH-HUH
OKAY
OKAY I HAVE A POWERPOINT PRESENTATION AND UH IT'S ABOUT THERE ARE SOME REVIEWS OF THE OF THE I THINK LIKE SEVEN MOVIES
WHAT ABOUT YOU DENIS
AND I HAVE A UH WELL JUST A A PIECE OF PAPER WITH SOME SUGGESTIONS
UH-HUH
YEAH I HAVE ALSO UH A PIECE OF PAPER WITH UH MY FAVOURITE MOVIE
UH-HUH
OKAY SO
YEAH
SHOULD WE START WITH THE TWO PRESENTATIONS MAYBE
OKAY
PRESENTATION
YEAH
A AGNES WE CAN START WITH YOU
SURE
IT'S NOT VERY LONG IN ANY CASE
OKAY HERE IT IS
YEP
YEAH
I PASSED THIS ONE
APOCALYPSE NOW AND AMADEUS WERE FAIRLY HISTORICAL SERIOUS DRAMATIC AND ALSO ACTION EY MOVIES EXCEPT FOR MAYBE AMADEUS
OKAY SO WHAT I WAS THINKING IS BASICALLY THE PREVIOUS MOVIES THAT WE HAD WHICH YOU'VE ALREADY MENTIONED IN THE AGENDA D UM LAWRENCE OF ARABIA
UM THIS MONTH I WAS THINKING OF SELECTING SOMETHING THAT'S MORE IN THE PRESENT TIME STILL DRAMATIC BUT SLIGHTLY LESS SERIOUS
OR YOU SEE WHERE THE CLUES WERE AND MM WHAT LED UP TO THE END SO THAT'S MORE ALONG THE LINES OF WHAT I WAS THINKING
AND YOU PICK UP ON THINGS THAT YOU DIDN'T REALLY NOTICE THE FIRST TIME AROUND
AND WHAT I'D PROPOSE IS SOMETHING OF A THRILLER OR MYSTERY
UM BUT IN THE NINETIES THERE WERE SOME MOVIES THAT DID HAVE SURPRISE ENDINGS AND THAT PEOPLE CAME OUT SAYING OKAY
AND EVEN IF PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY SEEN THE MOVIE A LOT OF THE TIMES YOU GO BACK AND WATCH THE MOVIE AGAIN
AND I KNOW THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE FIND MYSTERY IS NOT REALLY MYSTERIOUS IN THE MOVIES THESE DAYS THEY KIND OF CAN PREDICT WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN
DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING SO I THOUGHT WE COULD MAYBE SHOW ONE OF THOSE
MM-HMM
AND THE TWO IN PARTICULAR THAT I WOULD PROPOSE ARE
AND IT'S BASICALLY ABOUT FIVE CRIMINALS WHO GET SET UP
IT HAS A FAIRLY LARGE CAST SO I'M NOT GONNA READ ALL OF THEM BUT THE MAIN CHARACTERS ARE KEVIN SPACEY AND GABRIEL BYRNE
UM THEY'RE ARRESTED THEY'RE RELEASED FROM PRISON AND THE GET TOGETHER UM AND PLAN A CRIME
UH THE USUAL SUSPECTS WAS DIRECTED BY BRYAN SINGER AND WRITTEN BY CHRISTOPHER MCQUARRIE
AND BASICALLY THE STORY IS TOLD THROUGH THE VIEWS OF ONE OF THE SUSPECTS
UM I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE SEEN ANY OF THEM
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE THE USUAL SUSPECTS AND THE SIXTH SENSE
AND IN THE END YOU FIND WHO THE UBER VILLAIN WAS
AND I KIND OF LIKE THE THE QUOTE FROM ROLLING STONE MAGAZINE THE USUAL SUSPECTS IS THE FRESHEST FUNNIEST
UM THE TAG LINE IS KIND OF NEAT FIVE CRIMINALS ONE LINEUP
NO COINCIDENCE AND YOU GET TOLD THE STORY UM AS UH THAT THESE F CHARACTERS ARE BEING CONTROLLED UM BY ONE SORT OF UBER VILLAIN
THE GUY WHO WAS CONTROLLING
I DON'T REMEMBER I HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE TWICE BUT UH
WHICH WHICH ONE WAS IT AGAIN
WELL THEY HA HAVE YOU GUYS SEEN THE MOVIE
NO I HAVEN'T SEEN IT
NO I HAVEN'T
IT'S THE BALD GUY THE
SO I'M NOT GONNA GIVE AWAY YOU WANT ME TO GIVE AWAY THE MOVIE
I'LL TELL YOU LATER
THAT'LL SPOIL IT
BUT THE THE QUOTE FROM ROLLING STONE IS FAIRLY ACCURATE I THINK
IT'S ONE OF THE FRESHEST FUNNIEST AND SCARIEST CRIME THRILLERS TO COME ALONG SINCE PULP FICTION
NO NO
OKAY
HALEY JOEL OSMENT AND TONI COLLETTE AND AGAIN HAS A NEAT TWIST THAT YOU FIND OUT RIGHT AT THE END
AND THE OTHER MOVIE IS THE SIXTH SENSE WITH THE FAMOUS LINE I SEE DEAD PEOPLE WHICH THE LITTLE BOY SAYS
UM IT WAS WRITTEN AND DIRECTED BY M. NIGHT UH SHYAMALAN AND STARS BRUCE WILLIS
YEAH IT'S A BIT MORE COMMERCIAL THAT ONE
FIRST ONE
UM
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH THE SIXTH SENSE WAS VERY COMMERCIAL BUT
SO W WHAT WHAT IS THIS S THE SECOND IMAGE ON THE SLIDE
IS IT THE THE POSTER OR
ANYWAYS
IT'S THE POSTER FOR THE SIXTH SENSE BUT UNFORTUNATELY I COULDN'T FIND A CLEAR BIG ENOUGH ONE
HAS A S IT HAS A STRANGE FORMAT UM HORIZONTAL AND UH SO IT'S ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX
YEAH I TH I THINK IT'S ONLY PART OF A FULL YEAH IT GOES TH THE ALL OF THE SE ALL OF THE SENSES
UM IF YOU GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE THERE'S SLIGHTLY MORE DETAILED THINGS ABOUT THE MOVIES
SO THE USUAL SUSPECTS IS A HUNDRED AND FIVE MINUTES LONG SO IT'S A DECENT LENGTH OF TIME
IT HAS AN R. RATING SO I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT TYPE OF AUDIENCE WE HAD AT THE LAST
YEAH
MM-HMM
UH SHOWS BUT IT MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE SUITABLE FOR KIDS
UM
R. IS WHAT UH IN
R. IS SORT OF IF YOU'RE EIGHTEEN AND UNDER YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN ADULT WITH YOU
OKAY
HMM
SO IT MEANS RESTRICTED
UH-HUH
UM IT GOT AN EIGHT POINT SEVEN OUT OF TEN ON THE INTERNET MOVIE DATABASE
IT WON UM A COUPLE OF ACADEMY AWARDS NOTABLY FOR BEST WRITING UM SO THAT'S FOR THE SCRIPT UM AND BEST ACTOR FOR KEVIN SPACEY
IT'S THE SIXTEENTH IN THE TOP F TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MOVIES AND FOURTH IN THE TOP MOVIES OF THE NINETIES
IT'S MOSTLY FOR VIOLENCE YEAH IT'S RESTRICTED
RESTRICTED
MM-HMM
NO THE TOP FIFTY
BUT WAIT I I HAVE THE TOP TEN FROM THE NINETIES
AND IT'S FOURTH
MM-HMM
SIXTEENTH IN THE TOP TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY I THINK OF ALL TIME
YEAH FOURTH IN THE TOP MOVIES OF THE NINETIES
YEAH YEAH
OH SORRY SORRY YEP
MM-HMM MM-HMM MM-HMM
YEAH BECAUSE YOUR TABLE IS ONLY THE NINETIES YEAH
MM-HMM
FROM YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
NINETIES YEAH
SO IT WON LOTS OF AWARDS UM IT WON BEST FILM FROM THE BRITISH UM BRITISH FILM ASSOCIATION OR THE BRITISH EQUIVALENT OF THE ACADEMY AWARDS
UM IT WAS NOMINATED FOR BEST FOREIGN FILM FOR THE CESAR
SO PLENTY OF AWARDS WE WE COULD SAY
PLENTY OF AWARDS YEAH
BUT BUT SIXTEENTH IN TOP TWO HUNDRED FIFTY IT'S WHAT TWO UH ALL ALL DAYS
ALL TIME
WELL
I THINK OF ALL TIME YEAH
OF ALL THE MOVIES YEAH YEAH
YEAH
SO
IT'S STILL GOOD ACTUALLY
OKAY
YEAH
BUT THOSE RATING ARE MORE LIKE UH IT'S THE NUMBER OF VOTES NO
W W
YEAH IT'S RATINGS BY VIEWERS AND
VOTES AND U
NO NO ACTUALLY IF YOU LOOK AT YOUR TABLES
BECAUSE THERE ARE IN YOU TABLE YOU HAVE UH THINGS THAT HAVE VERY FEW VOTES BUT STILL ARE RANKED QUITE HIGH
I THINK IT'S A SORT OF UH WELL AVERAGE BETWEEN NUMBER OF VOTES AND AND AND UH YEAH THE THE RATING OR TH THE MARKS
FOR INSTANCE NUMBER TWENTY FOUR WHICH HAS ONLY FOUR THOUSAND VOTES
BY THE USERS
YEP
AND RATING
YEP
YEAH LIKE MEMORIES
YEAH YEAH
YEAH AND FORTY FOUR AS WELL WHICH HAS SEVEN HUNDRED AND FORTY SOMETHING VOTES
BUT UM YEAH
SO THAT YOU KNOW HOW HOW RELIABLE YEAH
SO IT'S DEFINITELY JUST THE AVERAGE OF THE RATING AND OKAY TH THE NUMBER OF THE VOTES IS THERE JUST FOR THE INFORMATION
YEP
YEAH
BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE JUST TEN VOTES AND YEAH PROBABLY ARE NOT IN THE DATABASE
MAYBE IT'S JUST THE SEARCH IS COMPENSATED A BIT FOR THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE I I DON'T KNOW ACTUALLY
YES
MM
OKAY
OKAY THEN YOU YEAH
THEN YES YES YES YES SURE
YEAH SO
HAVEN'T SEEN IT BUT
BUT YEAH ANYWAY IT HAS EXCELLENT VOTES
OKAY YEP
YEAH UM
YEAH
'CAUSE APPARENTLY THERE ARE HINTS AS TO WHO IT IS
BECAUSE I DO KNOW THE ENDING AND I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO WATCH IT AGAIN TO SEE WHERE THE HINTS WERE THAT WERE SCATTERED ACROSS THE MOVIE
NO IT'S A GOOD MOVIE I I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT AND I WOULDN'T MIND SEEING IT AGAIN
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
AH NOW I REMEMBER
OH
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
YEP
YEAH
ACTUALLY THERE IS ONE GUY WHO IS THE AT THE POLICE STATION AND THEY ASK HIM TO TELL THE STORY
YEAH
YEAH
AND HE'S THE ONE TELLING THE STORY YEAH
MM-HMM MM-HMM
THERE'S HIM AND THE THE GUY IN THE BURN UNIT
YEP
AND WHAT IS THE SECOND MOVIE
UM AGAIN IT WAS NOMINATED FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT ACADEMY AWARDS UM IT DIDN'T WIN ANY
IT GOT AN EIGHT POINT ONE OUT OF TEN
UM GOT A FAIR NUMBER OF VOTES TOO NINETY SIX THOUSAND
IT HAS AN EASIER RATING IT'S P. G. THIRTEEN UM IT'S MUCH LESS VIOLENT
YEAH IT'S NINETEENTH
BUT IT GOT A LOT OF BUZZ AND A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKED IT SO
THE SECOND MOVIE IS THE SIXTH SENSE
AGAIN IT'S FAIRLY SHORT
IT'S A HUNDRED AND FIRST IN THE TOP TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY AND IT'S NINETEENTH ON YOUR LIST I THINK IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN
YEAH SIXTH SEN
MM-HMM
THOSE ARE MY TWO SELECTIONS AND AS YOU CAN SEE THE PLOT IS A BOY WHO COMMUNICATES WITH SPIRITS THAT DON'T KNOW WHEN THEY'RE DEAD
SEEKS THE HELP OF A DISHEARTENED CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST TO FIGURE OUT WHY HE'S SEEING WHAT HE'S SEEING AND
WHAT IT MEANS
IT'S UH
BOTH MOVIES ARE QUITE SIMILAR IN SOME WAY BECAUSE THE LAST SENTENCE IS UH TOTALLY CONTRADICTORY TO THE WHOLE MOVIE
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
THE LAST SENTENCE FROM THE MOVIE OR OH
YEAH THE LAST SENTENCE FROM THE MOVIE
IT'S ONLY RIGHT RIGHT AT THE END WHERE YOU FIND OUT REALLY WHAT'S GOING ON AND IT MAKES YOU RETHINK EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED BEFOREHAND
YEAH
W
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
SO THOSE WOULD BE MY TWO SUGGESTIONS AND Y THEY AR THEY ARE SLIGHTLY MORE COMMERCIAL
OR AT LEAS THE SIXTH SENSE IS THAN THE OTHER ONES WE'VE SEEN BUT
MM-HMM
SO THESE GUYS WERE ACTUALLY NOMINATED SO THE THE BOTTOM PART OF YOUR SLIDE ACTUALLY IT SAYS YEAH SO THESE ARE THE BEST AWARDS THEY HAD
YEAH
YEAH THEY WERE THEY WERE NOMINATED FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT AWARDS THEY DIDN'T WIN
OKAY
TOO BAD
UH-HUH
WELL THERE IS JUST ONE WINNER SO
MM-HMM
BUT I GUESS THE COMP I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT THE COMPETITION WAS THAT YEAR BUT
AND THEY WERE NOMINATED FOR A LOT OF THEM AND UM
YEAH
OKAY
YOU HAVE A LAST SLIDE OR NO
YEAH THAT'S IT
SO I THINK THAT'S IT UNLESS YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS
OKAY
OKAY NOW YOU CAN GO TO TO MY SLIDES
BUT ACTUALLY WHAT I PRE WHAT I HAVE PREPARED IS JUST A KIND OF A REVIEW OF FO UH SE SIX OR SEVEN MOVIES
IF YOU CA CAN GO TO THE SECOND SLIDE
OKAY
YEAH
YOU SENT YOUR SLIDES AROUND RIGHT
UM YOU SEE THE THE NAMES OF THE MOVIES ON THE ON THE ON THE WALL
UH IT'S UH IT'S UH VERY UH HIGH RANKED AND ACTUALLY YOU HAVE A A NICER LIST BECAUSE UH WE CAN EVEN SEE THE NUMBER OF THE VOTES
YES BASICALLY SEVEN MOVIES AND IT'S UH IT'S UH UH TOP MOVIES UH BASED ON THE UH ON THE RA RANKING AND A AND AWARDS AWARDS
SO UM WE CAN PERHAPS GO THROUGH ALL OF THEM AND WE CAN LITTLE BIT DISCUSS SO I I I HAVE N I DIDN'T SEE ALL OF THEM ACTUALLY
SO WHAT IS THE NUMBER OF THE PEOPLE
SO IF YOU CAN GO THROUGH UH OKAY SO THIS IS THE FIRST MOVIE AND UH IT'S IT'S M IT'S MORE LIKE A DRAMA
SO IT'S JUST WE SHOULD PROBABLY SELECT ONE OF THESE BECAUSE I THINK UH THESE ARE REALLY GOOD MOVIES AND UH OKAY WE WILL SEE
OKAY
YEAH ONE HUNDRED F W UH ONE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND
YEAH I THINK YOUR TABLE IS VERY CLEAR DENIS
FINALLY I FOUND ACTUALLY YOUR TABLE MUCH BETTER THAN MY THAN MY PRESENTATION BECAUSE PERHAPS HERE WE CAN WE CAN REALLY SEE I MEAN

WHAT IS THE RANKING
WE HA DIDN'T HAVE THE PLOT YEAH
OKAY BUT MAYBE WE CAN WH WHO HAS SEEN THIS MOVIE

I THINK I I I'VE SEEN IT ACTUALLY BUT
W WHAT IS THE NAME IN FRENCH 'CAUSE
I HAVE NO IDEA
UH-HUH
UH YEAH

YEP
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
UH IT'S QUITE HI IT'S QUITE HIGH RANKED SO I THINK UH IT'S NOT A BAD MOVIE
THERE WAS SOMETHING LIKE A CELEBRATION OF THE
I'M UH THINKING WHETHER THERE WAS SOME GOOD OCCASION UH SOMETHING WHAT HAS HAPPENED RECENTLY
FIFTY YEARS AFTER THE WAR OR SOMETHING RECENTLY NO
AND IT'S ALSO I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA AT AT LEAST FROM MY POINT OF VIEW IT'S COHERENT WITH THE PREVIOUS FILMS LIKE HISTORY IM MAJOR EVENTS
BECAUSE THEY WERE LIBERATED BEGINNING FORTY FIVE AND UH YEAH IT'S NOT BAD
UM I THINK THERE WAS A CELEBRATION OF UH SIXTY YEARS FROM THE LIBERATION OF THE CAMPS ACTUALLY
I DON'T KNOW IF WE WANT TO KEEP THIS COHERENCE OR CHANGE RADICALLY BUT MAYBE YEAH THAT'S YEAH I THINK IT'S A DRAWBACK UH
NO THAT'S
S SIXTY YEARS
SIXTY
S IT CAN'T BE FIFTY SURE
SIXTY YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH SO
MM-HMM
YEP
YEP
THAT'S RIGHT YEAH
THAT'S TRUE
MM-HMM
THAT'S ONE THING TO KEEP IN MIND IS THAT IT'S
IT'S A FAIRLY EMOTIONAL MOVIE THOUGH
IT'S MORE A MOVIE ABOUT THE STORY OF UH THE HORROR OF THE UH ENDURED BY THE JEWISH DURING THE SECOND WORLD WAR
BUT THEN IT'S NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE NINETIES
YEAH BUT AMADEUS ISN'T REALLY REPRESENTATIVE OF THE EIGHTIES EITHER
YEAH AND ACCORDING TO YOUR THING IT'S NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR SO
WELL OF THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTIES
YEAH RIGHT
YES
YES YES YES
BUT
YEAH
MAYBE IT'S REPRESENTATIVE OF A STYLE OF THE EIGHTIES I DON'T KNOW
AS FOR AMADEUS BUT UH THAT'S I DON'T KNOW
YEAH YEAH
UM BUT EVEN HERE I WOULDN'T UH UH SAY THAT THE THAT TH THIS STYLE IS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE NINETIES RIGHT SO
NO
YEAH HARD TO TELL
UM
OKAY BUT UH ANYWAY I THINK IT'S IT'S REALLY A GOOD MOVIE I LIKE IT WHEN I SAW IT AND UH OKAY
MM-HMM
IT IS A GOOD MOVIE YEAH
OKAY AND STEVEN STEVEN SPIELBERG IS UH
SO I WOULD KEEP IT AS A CANDIDATE AT LEAST
SO I I WOULD SAY WE WE COULD THINK ABOUT IT
IT'S ONE OF THE CANDIDATES I DEFINI YEAH STEVEN SPIELBERG IS REALLY QUITE A GOOD SO I DIRECTOR
YEAH
OKAY
MM-HMM
YEAH
THAT'S THE SECOND ONE
OKAY THE USUAL SUSPECT DO WE WANT TO SAY SOMETHING AGAIN ABOUT IT OR
UM NO
I THINK WE CAN JUST SKIP THIS SLIDE
HOW COME IT'S COMING THIRD
ON YOUR LIST
YEAH
UH YEAH
IT'S
IT'S FORTH ON AGNES'S UH AND ON MY LIST BUT IT'S OKAY
AH YOU J YOU SELECTED SOME MOVIES NO
YOU DIDN'T TAKE THE SIX FIRST
THAT'S STRANGE WHAT IS THE RATING
NO THEY HAVE THE SAME USUAL SUSPECTS AND PULP FICTION BOTH ARE AT EIGHT POINT SEVEN
BUT ON DENIS'S TABLE UH THIS ONE IS AT EIGHT POINT SIX
YEAH IT'S FUNNY ACTUALLY UM BECAUSE ON YOUR ON YOUR SLIDES ACTUALLY THE RATINGS ARE EIGHT POINT SEVEN FOR BOTH
WHO KNOWS MAYBE PEOPLE VOTED FOR IT YEAH
COULD HAVE CHANGED IN THE MEANWHILE
PERHAPS IT HAS CHANGED
IT'S HIGHER
BUT IT GETS UPDATED DAILY
IT GETS UPDATED
YES YES AND I DID IT I DID IT ON WEDNESDAY
YEAH
AND ME ON TUESDAY PROBABLY
I MEAN GIVEN THE NUMBER OF VOTES I WONDER BUT ANYWAY IT'S M IT MAY CHANGE I THINK YEAH
THOUGH WITH ONE HUNDRED AND THOUSAND VOTES IT SHOULDN'T CHANGE TOO MUCH

SO THAT THEY COME TO OUR MOVIE CLUB SO YEAH
MM-HMM
SEE I DON'T KNOW WHAT WAS MAINSTREAM IN EUROPE LIKE ALL OF THESE MOVIES ARE VERY MAINSTREAM FOR ME
YEAH
YEAH I THINK ALSO IF YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF VOTES HERE
BUT
IF THEY ARE IN THE TOP FIFTY THEY ARE QUITE MAINSTREAM BUT UH
MM-HMM
UH
YEAH
UH REGARDING THE DENIS'S TABLE I WOULD SAY GIVEN THAT THIS SITE I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S MAINLY AMERICAN BUT UH I WOULD SAY THAT
IT HAS OTHER MOVIES BUT I THINK IT'S PREDOMINANTLY
UH I THINK THERE IS THE
YEAH I THINK MM YEAH IT'S ENGLISH SPEAKING ANYWAY SO UH THOUGH SO
MM-HMM
THERE ARE CHINESE MOVIES ENGLISH MOVIES
YEAH BUT IF YOU LOOK AT
NO THERE'S MOVIES FROM EVERYWHERE BUT
TWENTY THOUSAND LIKE MM PRINCESS MONONOKE TWENTY THOUSAND AND UH WHATEVER THE THE KIESLOWSKI AT ELEVEN THOUSAND THE TROIS COLEURS ROUGE
AND YOU CAN SEE SOME MORE WELL CONFIDENTIAL FILMS THAT HAVE LIKE TEN THOUSAND
YEAH BUT I WOULD SAY MAINSTREAM ARE THE ONES THAT HAVE MORE THAN WHATEVER SIXTY THOUSAND VOTES
MM-HMM
I WAS SURPRISED TO S YEAH YEAH
IT'S IT'S QUITE A LOT FOR KIESLOWSKI ACTUALLY
YEAH IT'S NOT BAD AT ALL YEAH
SO YEAH ANYWAY IF YOU WANT A DEFINITION OF MAINSTREAM OR WHATEVER
HMM
YEAH
UH I I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE SEEN THIS ONE
AND FESTEN ALSO IS UH IS QUITE HIGH
IT'S THE CELEBRATION I THINK
IT'S UH UH MOVIE FROM A SWEDISH GUY
MM-HMM
YEP
NO I'VE NEVER EVEN HEARD OF IT
YEAH
D UH DANISH I THINK IT'S THE DOGMA MOVEMENT
DOGMA MOVIES YEAH
LARS VON TRIER
DANISH
YEAH
OH OKAY
YEAH
MM-HMM
OKAY CAN WE
YEAH LET'S UH
DISCUSS ABOUT YOUR DOCUMENT MAYBE
ACTUALLY I I TRIED TO PROPOSE JUST ONE MOVIE WITH SOME ALTERNATES
UH YOU WANT ONE
YEAH SO IT'S UH ACTUALLY I HAVE MADE I HAVE MADE PHOTOCOPIES
I HAVE THEM DENIS SO IT'S ALL FOR YOU
MAYBE CAN I ASK YOU FOR THE FOR THE LIST OF MOVIES
YEP
OKAY
OKAY
THANK YOU
THIS ONE
AND THE
YEAH
BUT YOU HAVE YOUR OWN COPY THEN
DENIS DENIS COULD YOU GIVE ME THE THE LIST OF THE TO UH TOP FIFTY
OKAY GOOD THANK YOU
YEAH SURE
YEP
UM SO MY PROPOSAL WHICH IS ONLY A PROPOSAL WOULD BE TO TO KEEP THE FOCUS ON UM UH MORE OR LESS HISTORY AND ACTION
THAT'S MUCH UH MUCH EARLIER AND IT'S NOT ABOUT IT'S NOT VIOLENT WHICH IS A NICE THING I THINK
OKAY OUTSIDE EUROPE AND THE STATES BUT UH IT'S A PIECE OF HISTORY
SO LAWRENCE OF ARABIA WAS OKAY ABOUT THIS GUY DURING THE FIRST WORLD WAR SO IT HAPPENS
UH APOCALYPSE NOW IT'S UH VIETNAM IF I'M UM CORRECT AND OKAY AMADEUS
BUT UM GIVEN THAT WE WOULD LIKE A MOVIE FROM THE NINETIES I THOUGHT THE SAVING PRIVATE RYAN OH THANKS FOR PROJECTING THE DOCUMENT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
BECAUSE IT'S IT'S NOT LIKE THE SORT OF GLORIFICATION OF UH YOU KNOW THE GOOD GUYS THAT THAT UH WELL GO AGAINST THE NAZIS
WHILE SHOWING ACTUALLY A VERY NEW AND I WOULD SAY HUMANISTIC VIEW ON ON WAR
UM WOULD KEEP THIS MORE OR LESS THIS THEME OF UH HISTORY AND WAR AND ACTION DRAMA
BUT UH IT'S UH IT'S WELL THE PLOT ACTUALLY IF YOU DON'T KNOW IT
WHO ACTUALLY THREE OF THEM GET KILLED DURING THE WAR IN THESE DAYS OF FORTY WELL
IT'S ABOUT PEOPLE LOOKING FOR JUST ONE SOLDIER IN FACT IT'S UM IT'S ABOUT A A FAMILY OF FOUR BROTHERS
I GUESS SUMMER FORTY FOUR AND THE UH WELL THE GOVERNMENT DECIDES THAT THEY NEED TO GET BACK THE FOURTH BROTHER JUST TO SAVE ONE MEMBER OF THE FAMILY
AND THIS THIS GUY IS PRIVATE RYAN
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
AND ESPECIALLY THE THE BEGINNING IS UH I THINK IT'S GREAT IT'S IT'S VERY VIOLENT BUT IT'S IT'S AN IMAGE OF OF WAR
SO BUT OF COURSE THE THE SETTING IS DURING THE WAR AND UM IT'S VERY REALISTIC AND UH VERY DRAMATIC IN FACT
IT'S UH
SO THE MOVIE IS NOT ABOUT KILLING THE GERMANS OR WHATEVER IT'S ABOUT SAVING AT LEAST ONE GUY FROM A FAMILY
IT'S UM IT'S NOT AT ALL A GLORIFICATION OF WAR BUT IT'S JUST UH IT SHOWS A BIT UH THE VIOLENCE OF UM OF THE THINGS
IT'S QUITE HORRIBLE ACTUALLY
YEAH
IT'S V VERY VERY VIOLENT
YEAH BUT I THINK IF MM WELL IF YOU COMPARE IT WITH
YEAH
MIREK YOU DIDN'T SEE IT
OKAY YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH THAT WAS REALLY HORRIBLE
THAT'S THE I I I SAW IT AND I D I'M TRYING TO REMEMBER THE BEGINNING THAT'S THE NORMANDY LANDING
THE LANDING YEAH
IT YEAH IT'S THE LANDING AND ACTUALLY EVERY MORE OR LESS EVERYONE GETS KILLED AND
YEAH
THIS IS NOT A MOVIE FOR KIDS LIKE
YEAH
BUT IT'S IT'S A PIECE OF ART BECAUSE HE USED SOMETHING LIKE ONE HUNDRED CAMERA TO FILM THAT OR
YEAH
BUT IT'S TRUE IT'S IT'S A BIT VIOLENT AND SO WHAT I PUT HERE IT'S A BIT LONG TOO IT'S NEARLY THREE HOURS
I KNOW IT'S VERY NICE SOMEONE FALLS SOMEWHERE THERE AND WELL YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE BATTLES THAT LOOK NICE BUT THIS ONE DOESN'T LOOK NICE
AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU COMPARE WITH I DON'T KNOW IN LAWRENCE OF ARABIA I THINK THEY HAVE SOME BATTLES AND CAMELS
AND I THINK IT'S UH IT'S ALSO MAYBE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE NINETIES YOU KNOW PEOPLE STARTING TO GET THE MORE UH REALISTIC VIEW OF UH OF OF WAR
OH I I DIDN'T KNOW BUT YEAH ACTUALLY IT'S VERY WELL FILMED AND IT'S VERY REALISTIC
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEP
MM-HMM MM-HMM
YEAH IT'S QUITE S YEAH
NO NOT AT ALL
BUT UH I DON'T KNOW APOCALYPSE NOW IS QUITE LONG TOO I THINK
YEAH
THERE IS TWO THERE ARE TWO VERSIONS I THINK AND BUT W BUT WE YEAH WE PROJECTED THE LONGER ONE SO
YEAH IT IS
I DON'T REMEMBER
YEAH THE REDUX VERSION IS LONGER
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
SO IT WON UH FIVE OSCAR PRIZES UH BEST DIRECTOR FOR STEVEN SPIELBERG UM BEST CIMENA CINEMATOGRAPHY ETCETERA
UH
HOW MANY TIMES UH SPIELBERG RECEIVED THE BEST UH DIRECTOR OSCAR
I THINK JUST ONCE FOR THIS
I DON'T KNOW
NOT FOR THE SCHIN SCHINDLER'S LIST OR FOR
OH MAYBE HE DID
FOR E. T.
NO FOR E. T. HE DIDN'T
IT WASN'T UNTIL HE STARTED DOING THINGS LIKE SCHINDLER'S LIST AND SAVING PRIVATE RYAN THAT HE ACTUALLY STARTED WINNING AWARDS FOR THEM

HMM

OH OKAY YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT
UH IN THE TRIVIA I FOUND OUT THAT IN FACT THEY UH ACTUALLY REDUCED THE THE COLOUR SATURATION OF THE MOVIE
JUST TO MAKE IT LOOK MAYBE A BIT LIKE THE DOCUMENTARIES FROM THE TIME
UM OKAY SO UM YEAH THAT'S THAT'S THE POINT IT'S IT'S A BIT GREY AND ACTUALLY IF YOU LOOK AT MY SECOND PAGE
YEAH I WAS VERY SURPRISED TO FIND THIS UH IT'S
MM-HMM
THAT WAS VERY INTERESTING TO READ YEAH
TH THEY TURNED BACK TO YEAH
BUT THEN THEY UH I READ THAT THEY THEY W WHERE WAS IT

BECAUSE PEOPLE START TO COMPLAIN THAT UH THAT W THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH A T. V. WHEN THEY WERE BROADCASTING THE MOVIE ON THE T. V.
YEAH
THAT IT WAS THEIR T. V. S AND NOT
I DON'T KNOW IN IN THE ROOM
SO I I MEAN THESE FOUR POINTS COULD SERVE ALSO AS AN INTRODUCTION IF YOU WANT TO TALK F FO FOR FI FIVE OR TEN MINUTES BEFORE THE MOVIE
SO UH YEAH MM SO THA THIS WOULD BE MY CANDIDATE BUT I'M VERY MUCH OPEN TO
SO YEAH
SO THIS UH FACT NUMBER TWO I THINK OBVIOUSLY FOR I MEAN TECHNICAL PEOPLE LIKE US IS UH IS IS IS QUITE FUNNY
YEAH
THAT'S AN INTERESTING POINT INTERESTING POINT
THE IN THE PREVIOUS MOVIES THERE WERE AN HE AN HERO LAWRENCE OF ARABIA UH AMADEUS
AND THEN THEN THERE IS THIS UH THERE IS AN HERO I MEAN IT'S UH OR A NON HERO AND IN ALL THE OTHER STU STORIES
APOCALYPSE NOW IT'S ALSO NON HERO I THINK BUT UH BUT HERE I DON'T REMEMBER IT'S ACTUALLY THE TOM HANKS THE HERO OR IT'S
MM-HMM

YEAH
YEAH ON TH ON YEAH ON THE PICTURE ACTUALLY YEAH IT'S TOM HANKS
IN FACT YOU YOU DON'T SEE UH PRIVATE RYAN UNTIL THE END MORE OR LESS OR YOU SEE MM BECAUSE THEY THEY'RE LOOKING FOR HIM YEAH

MM-HMM
NO HE'S NOT

YEAH EXACTLY YEAH HE DIES UNFORTUNATELY
IT'S NOT THE PRIVATE RYAN
AND BECAUSE HE DIDN'T KILL THIS GERMAN THE GERMAN KILLED I DON'T KNOW UH MAYBE UM
BECAUSE THERE WERE A GUY WHO WAS WHO DIDN'T KILL GERMAN BECAUSE HE WAS QUITE NON VIOLENT
AT THE END TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH I DIDN'T LIKE SO MUCH THE MOVIE BECAUSE IT WAS QUITE MORALISTIC
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OH
PERHAPS IT WAS A G UH THIS UH TOM HANKS YEAH
YEP
MM-HMM

A MOVIE OR A NOVEL
UH IT'S ACTUALLY THE T WHERE I'VE SEEN THAT

WE SEE WORSE PEOPLE
SO IT'S KIND OF UH AN ETHNOGRAPHIC MOVIE I WOULD SAY BUT UH AND IT'S A MODERN HERO IT'S IT'S QUITE FUN
SO IT'S A KIND OF IT'S LIKE AMERICAN BEAUTY IN SOME WAY IT'S EVEN WORSE
AND THE CASTING IS IS MARVELLOUS SO THAT IS THAT'S IT FOR THIS MOVIE
I DON'T KNOW A REFERENCE
AND UM I JUST WANTED TO GO TO THE DESIGN OF THE POSTER ACTUALLY

I QUITE LIKE THAT
YEAH
IT'S PROBABLY A BIT DARK FOR A POSTER BUT OTHERWISE IT'S VERY NICE

UH I WANTED TO SAY SOME INFORMATION TO INVOLVE PEOPLE ON IN THE COMMITTEE AS WELL IF THEY WANT TO TAKE PART TO THE COMMITTEE TO SELECT MOVIES
YEAH
AND UH WHAT ELSE
MM-HMM
S SOME
EVEN IF THEY HAVEN'T SEE IT
THE BIG LEBOWSKI IT'S CLEAR THAT IT'S A MOVIE AND UH I GUESS THE PEOPLE CAN REMEMBER THAT IT WAS A MOVIE AT LEAST
I THINK THIS IS NOT BAD BECAUSE THEY SAY SOMETHING LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUR UH MOVIE CLUB AND UH YEAH
LOOKS LIKE A C. D. COVER
MM-HMM
CD COVER
YEAH ACTUALLY THE IDEA WAS TO S YEAH THERE IS AT THE BOTTOM THE A SCENE FROM ONE OF THESE DREAM OF THE BIG LEBOWSKI
YEAH
OH OKAY IT'S A DREAM
AND THE COWBOY IT'S ACTUALLY AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MOVIE
AND HE'S E EXPLAINING WHAT KIND OF MOVIE UH YOU ARE GOING TO TO SEE

MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OH OKAY
OKAY SOUNDS A BIT CRAZY
AND LAST POSTERS
YEAH
HMM
SO SAME PRINCIPLE BUT I W I DON'T KNOW I W I WAS THINKING OF ADDING SOME SOME UM CITA QUOTATIONS OF UH WELL KNOWN DIRECTORS
UH-HUH
YEAH
AND UH
I LIKE IT BECAUSE IT'S NOT SO DARK SO THE IMAGES ARE A BIT UM BRIGHTER
YEAH BUT I ON THE CONTRARY I WOULD SAY THERE IS TOO MANY COLOURS AND UH IT'S DIFFICULT TO READ AND UH
IT'S IT LOOKS LIKE TWO SEPARATE POSTERS
I ACTUALLY DON'T LIKE IT
IT LOOKS LIKE TWO YEAH
ALTHOUGH I THINK YOU CAN MIX I WOULD KEEP THE FORMAT OF THE FIRST ONE ADD THE QUOTES AND THE CONTENT INFORMATION FROM THE SECOND ONE
YEAH YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH THAT WOULD BE THE BEST
HOW TO JOIN KIND OF IN THE MIDDLE AND KEEP THIS TITLE AND EVERYTHING JUST SLIGHTLY HIGHER UP
PUT THE THE INFORMATION YOU HAD IN THE SECOND POSTER ABOUT THE MOVIE CLUB
SO TAKE THOSE TAKE THOSE QUOTES GET RID OF THAT SECTION OF TEXT PUT THOSE QUOTES IN THERE
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
MM-HMM
OKAY I SEE
WH WHAT ABOUT A BRIGHTER BACKGROUND BECAUSE THIS ONE I DON'T KNOW HOW IT WOULD SHOW ON A WALL OR SOMETHING LIKE THIS
IT DOESN'T REALLY CATCH YOUR ATTENTION

AND YEAH
'KAY
YEAH
MM
OKAY
YEAH
OKAY I SEE WHAT I WANTED IS MORE OR LESS TO KNOW THE CONTENT OF THE MOVIE UH WHAT Y YOU WANT TO HAVE ON THE POSTER

SO HELLO EVERYBODY
HELLO

UM HELLO
UM I DON'T DO YOU HAVE AN EXTRA COPY
THANKS
YEP
AND ALSO DISCUSS THE CONTENT FOR AN ADVER ADVERTISING POSTERS AND UM I I WILL PRESENT YOU THREE DES DIFFERENT DESIGN WE'LL DISCUSS IT
SO FIRST WE HAVE TO DECIDE FOR UM A MOVIE
SO THE GOAL FOR TODAY IS TO DECIDE FOR A MOVIE TO PROJECT AT THE END OF THE MONTH SO FOR THIS MONTH OF OF APRIL
MM-HMM
OKAY
SO I THINK WE ALL PREPARED DOCUMENTS
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YES I DID
SO I PROPOSE THAT WE START WITH UH PRESENTATION AGNES UH SENT
SURE
SOME MOVIES IN THE NINETIES DID ACTUALLY HAVE TWISTS THAT PEOPLE CAME OUT SAYING NEVER SAW THAT COMING I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THAT WAS GONNA HAPPEN
SO WHAT I'D PROPOSE IS ACTUALLY A THRILLER OR A MYSTERY
AND WHILE THESE DAYS PEOPLE ARE SO JADED BY GENERAL MOVIES THAT THEY TEND NOT TO BE SURPRISED BY THE ENDINGS IN MYSTERIES
SO FOR THIS MONTH I PROPOSE DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT PREFERABLY SOMETHING SET IN THE PRESENT UM SOMETHING MAYBE DRAMATIC BUT SLIGHTLY LESS SERIOUS
WHICH WERE ALL HISTORICAL SERIOUS DRAMATIC AND SOMEWHAT ACTIONY MOVIES
OKAY SO THE PREVIOUS MOVIES THAT WE'VE DONE THIS YEAR WERE LAWRENCE OF ARABIA APOP APOCALYPSE NOW AND AMADEUS
WHAT I'D PROPOSE IS EITHER THE USUAL SUSPECTS OR THE SIXTH SENSE
AND SO WHAT I'M GONNA DO IS PRESENT YOU TWO OF THOSE MOVIES AND BEFORE ANYONE SAYS THAT WELL
UM IS HAS A FAIRLY LARGE CAST NOTABLY KEVIN SPACEY GABRIEL BYRNE
IF YOU KNOW TH HOW THE MOVIE ENDS YOU'RE NOT GONNA WANNA SEE IT AGAIN THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE CASE
UM SO IF YOU CAN GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE
WHAT THEY MISSED THINGS THEY DIDN'T PAY ATTENTION TO THE FIRST TIME AROUND
IT WAS WRITTEN BY QUIST CHRISTOPHER MCQUARRIE
BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE TO RE WATCH MOVIES UM TO SEE WHERE THE CLUES WERE
UM AND IT WAS DIRECTED BY BRYAN SINGER IT'S ONE OF HIS EARLIER MOVIES I THINK
UM THE USUAL SUSPECTS IS SLIGHTLY LESS MAINSTREAM
MM
WHAT IT MEANS
UM IT WAS WRITTEN AND DIRECTED BY M. NIGHT UH SHYAMALAN AND STARS BRUCE WILLIS HALEY JOEL OSMENT AND TONI COLLETTE
UM AND ACCORDING TO ROLLING STONE IT'S THE FRESHEST FUNNIEST AND SCARIEST CRIME THRIL THRILLER TO COME ALONG SINCE PULP FICTION
UH THE SIXTH SENSE ON THE OTHER HAND IS A MORE COMMERCIAL MOVIE WITH ITS FAMOUS LINE I SEE DEAD PEOPLE
AND IT'S ABOUT A LITTLE BOY WHO SEES DEAD PEOPLE AND I HE SEES A CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST TO TRY TO GET HIM TO UNDERSTAND WHY HE SEES THE DEAD PEOPLE
AH
HMM
AND ACTUALLY THE PSYCHOLOGIST IS DEAD
UM
NOW THAT YOU'VE GIVEN AWAY THE TWIST YES
NO BUT WE'RE THE CLUBBERS BUT
WELL THAT'S PROBABLY NOT A VERY LONG TIME BECAUSE PULP FICTION IS NINETY FOUR AND USUAL SUSPECTS IS NINETY FIVE
OKAY
AGNES UH I WAS JUST WONDERING UH I SEE UH I HAVE HERE DENIS'S TABLE AND WHEN THEY SAY THAT IT'S THE FRESHEST WHATEVER SINCE PULP FICTION
YEAH
YEAH
YEP
MM
UH AS YOU CAN S WELL AS ANDREI ALREADY SAID IT'S N NINETEEN NINETY FIVE
'CAUSE IT'S FAIRLY VIOLENT BUT NOT SO VIOLENT AS OTHER MOVIES
SO ON THE NEXT COUPLE OF SLIDES I'LL JUST GO THROUGH SOME OF UM MORE DETAILED STUFF THAT WE MIGHT NEED FOR ADMINISTRATIVE PURPOSES
AFTER RELEASE THEY GET TOGETHER FOR A SPOT OF REVENGE BUT SOMEONE ELSE IS CONTROLLING EVENTS
SEND YOUR COMPLAINTS TO ROLLING STONE
UM PLOT OUTLINE UH FIVE VILLAINS IN NEW YORK ARE ROUNDED UP BY THE POLICE IN AN UNCONVENTIONAL MANNER THAT WORRIES THEM
UM THE LENGTH FOR THE USUAL SUSPECTS UM IS A HUNDRED AND FIVE MINUTES
IT HAS AN R. RATING WHICH MEANS THAT AT LEAST IN THE IN NORTH AMERICA IT WAS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PEOPLE UNDER EIGHTEEN
AND THE BIG MYSTERY OF THE MOVIE IS WHO'S CONTROLLING THE EVENTS
UM BEST FILM FOR THE BRITISH EQUIVALENT OF THE ACADEMY AWARDS IT WAS NOMINATED FOR A CESAR FOR BEST FOREIGN FILM
FORTH IN DENIS'S LIST OF THE TOP MOVIES OF THE NINETEEN NINETIES WHICH I THINK WAS ALSO TAKEN FROM I. M. D. B.
UM IT WON SEVERAL ACADEMY AWARDS INCLUDING BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR AND BEST WRITING
SO IT GOT A FAIR BIT OF RECOGNITION DESPITE NOT BEING
IT'S SIXTEENTH IN THE TOP TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MOVIES OF ALL TIME
UM IT GOT AN EIGHT POINT SEVEN OUT OF TEN USER RATING ON THE INTERNET MOVIE DATABASE
YEP
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
UM A VERY MAINSTREAM HIGH BUDGET MOVIE OR MAYBE BECAUSE IT WASN'T A MAINSTREAM HIGH BUDGET MOVIE
SO WHA WHAT WILL BE YOUR ARGUMENT FOR PROJECTING THIS MOVIE
I DON'T THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE SEEN IT IN FACT OTHER THAN
I HAVEN'T SEE IT
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT YOU'VE SEEN IT
I HAVEN'T SEEN IT
YEP
WHAT
AND DON'T THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE SEEN IT IT'S NOT A VERY VERY WELL KNOWN MOVIE
YEAH
IT'S VERY WELL KNOWN
IS IT
IT'S A
REALLY
IT'S ONE OF THE MOST WELL KNOWN THRILLER
I THINK YEAH
SEE
REALLY
THAT SURPRISES ME I ALWAYS GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT IT WAS
OH
YEAH
THAT'S MINE BUT UH
IT'S IT'S HARD TO TELL
SO THAT'S YOUR IMPRESSION
YEAH
BUT IT'S IT'S RATED FOUR FOURTH IN UH IN THE LIST AND ONE HUNDRED ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND
THAT'S MY IMPRESSION YEAH
YEAH
WELL IT'S A GOOD MOVIE
YEAH
HOW MANY PEOPLE VOTED FOR IT YEAH
THAT'S TRUE
SEEN IT
ONE HUNDRED AND TWO
FOR FOR VOTED FOR IT YEAH
ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND
YEAH
VOTED FOR IT
VOTED FOR IT AND I THINK ONLY TWO OTHER MOV UH NO F THREE OTHER MOVIES UH HAVE UH HAVE MORE VOTES
MORE VOTES
YEAH IT'S IT SEEMS TO BE QUITE POPULAR
YEAH
SO BUT I THINK THE MAIN THING IS IT'S GOT A GOOD TWIST AT THE END AND
MM-HMM MM-HMM
IT'S IT'S AN INTERESTING MOVIE TO WATCH
MM-HMM
OKAY
IT'S SLIGHTLY NEWER NINETEEN NINETY NINE MORE OR LESS THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME
MORE OR LESS THE SAME THING FOR THE SIXTH SENSE
IT HAS A LOWER RATING 'CAUSE IT'S LESS VIOLENT BUT IT DEPENDS WHAT AUDIENCE WE ARE GONNA HAVE AT THE SHOWINGS
UM SO IF YOU GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE
YEAH
ISN'T VIOLENT AT ALL IN FACT OR IT'S MORE LIKE SCARY OR
IT HAS IT'S SCARY AND I THINK IT HAS SOME SORT OF SLIGHT VIOLENCE BUT
UH-HUH
BUT THE KID IS SEEING DEAD PEOPLE I MEAN IS UH IT'S QUITE UH
YEAH BUT THEY'RE NOT VIOLENTLY DEAD
YEAH MORBID
NO BUT IT'S QUITE UH MORBID YOU CAN SAY THAT
CREEPY OR
SCARY OR YEAH MM-HMM
IT'S IT'S MORBID AND IT'S CREEPY BUT IT'S NOT VIOLENT AS IN PEOPLE BEING SLICED IN HALF OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
HUNDRED FIRST IN THE TOP TWO HUNDRED FIFTY IT WAS NOMINATED FOR A LOT OF AWARDS IT DIDN'T WIN
UM UM IT'S NINETEENTH IN THE TOP MOVIES OF THE NINETIES
YEAH
MM-HMM
NEVERTHELESS STILL A GOOD MOVIE STILL A GOOD TWIST AT THE END WHICH DENIS ALREADY GAVE AWAY
AS MANY
MIGHT HAVE WON MORE SORT OF MINOR AWARDS BUT AT LEAST THE ACADEMY AWARDS IT WAS NOMINATED FOR FIVE OF THEM UM BUT DIDN'T WIN
MM-HMM
THEY DON'T REMEMBER
MM-HMM
GOOD
UM SO THOSE WOULD BE MY TWO CHOICES
HAVE YOU SEEN IT
YEP
OKAY
SO WHAT WAS YOU CRITERIA FOR SELECTING THIS MOVIE OR
SO IT'S NOT YOUR GENERAL MOVIE WHERE YOU JUST KIND OF SIT THROUGH IT AND GO OH OKAY GET UP AND LEAVE
LET IT'S A SORT OF DIFFERENT STYLE FROM THE OTHER MOVIES WE'VE SEEN AND THEY HAVE A TWIST
IT'S AT LEAST OUT OF THOSE TWO MOVIES I CAME OUT THINKING OH COOL OKAY
BUT THEN IT'S ONLY AT THE AT THE END THAT IT IT BECOMES A GOOD MOVIE
MM-HMM
YEAH BUT
I MEAN THAT'S A GOOD THING RIGHT
ONLY BECAUSE OF THE OF THE END
OKAY
I I'VE HEARD SOME PEOPLE IN THE IN THE THEATRE SAYING OH NOW WE HAVE TO SEE IT AGAIN
YES
YEAH
AH
WHICH IS A GOOD MARKETING PLOY IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT
BUT THEN IF YOU ASKED THEM FIVE MINUTES AGO OKAY
IF WE SHOW IT TWICE
GREAT
AH
SO IS BRUCE WILLIS THE CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST
OKAY
YEAH BRUCE WILLIS IS AND THE KID IS REALLY GOOD WHO PLAYS THE THE MAIN CHARACTER
YEAH
MM-HMM
IT'S THE GUY WHO THEN PLAYED IN UH ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE OR SOMETHING LIKE THIS MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
GREAT
SAME GUY
WE CAN HAVE A LOOK
OKAY SO UH I THINK MIREK YOU PREPARED A PRESENTATION ALSO
YEAH
SO MY PRESENTATION IS NOT THAT DETAILED I JUST UH PUT THERE SEVEN UH HIGHLY UH RANKED MOVIES
AND WE CAN JUST TRY TO G UH GO VERY QUICKLY THROUGH ALL OF THEM JUST TO RE REMIND YOU THEM
AND THEN WE CAN PERHAPS CONSIDER ANOTHER P UH POTENTIAL CANDIDATES
SORRY IT'S CONTROL L.
UH SO PERHAPS WE CAN GO TO THE TO THE F TO THE FIRST MOVIE
SO THE MOVIES THAT I HAVE SELECTED AS AS VERY GOOD UH GOOD RANKED MOVIES UH ARE UH UH ARE ON THE SCREEN SO UH SHAW THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION
SCHINDLER'S LIST USUAL SUSPECTS PULP FICTION GOODFELLAS SILENCE OF THE LAMBS AND AMERICAN BEAUTY
UH THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPT UH REDEMPTION UM ACTUALLY I DIDN'T SEE THAT MOVIE SO IS THERE SOMEONE ELSE WHO HAVE SEEN THIS MOVIE
OKAY
MM
NO
UH ME NEITHER
I'VE HEARD A LOT OF REALLY GOOD THINGS ABOUT IT BUT
OKAY
I THI
WHICH IS NOT GOOD
I HAVE S I HAVE SEEN IT BUT I DON'T REMEMBER IT
SO UH I WAS TOLD THAT IN FRENCH IT WAS CALLED UH LES EVADEES
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
SO THAT'S UH WHAT IT SAYS OKAY WE CAN'T TELL MUCH MORE BECAUSE BASICALLY NONE OF US HAVE SEEN IT
AND THE USER COMMENT SAYS IT'S SIMPLY AMAZING THE BEST UH FILM OF THE NINETIES
CHANGES WHEN HE UH HE'S UH CONVICTED AND JAILED FOR THE MURDER OF HIS WIFE
OKAY THE PLOT OUTLINE SAYS THAT THE LIFE OF ANDY UH DUFRESNE DUF OKAY OF ANDY
YEAH
SHOULD WE SHOULD WE BELIEVE THIS
BUT THE RATING IS VERY GOOD THEN
UH THE PLOT OUTLINE IS THAT THE OSKAR SCHINDLER UH USES JEWS TO UH START A FACTORY IN POLAND DURING THE WAR
IT'S FROM THE ST UH STEVEN SPIELBERG AND IT'S ABOUT THE SECOND WAR UH SEC SECOND WORLD WAR
AND HE WITNESSES THE UH HORRORS UH ENDURED BY THE JEWS AND STARTS TO SAVE THEM
SO THE SECOND ONE IS A SCHINDLER'S LIST IT'S MORE SERIOUS MOVIE
USER COMMENT SAYS A FILM FOR ALL TO SEE AND LEARN AND I THINK IT'S REALLY SOMETHING WHAT IS VERY SERIOUS UH THEME AND UH YEAH
MM-HMM YEAH
MM-HMM
I I HAVE SEEN IT
I THINK IT'S REALLY GOOD MOVIE IT'S UH IT'S QUITE LONG ACTUALLY
SO THAT'S A SCHINDLER'S LIST UM WE CAN PERHAPS DO YOU HAVE SOME COMMENTS
I CAN'T UH HERE I DIDN'T PUT THE THE MINUTES BUT I THINK IT'S IT'S AT LEAST ABOUT THREE HOURS
YEAH I THINK IT'S ABOUT THREE HOURS LONG SOMETHING LIKE THAT
AND IT'S A HEAVY MOVIE I IT'S EMOTIONAL IT'S
MM-HMM
YEAH
IT YOU KNOW IF IT'S TO UH IF IT RECEIVED SOME AWARD
NO I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW UNFORTUNATELY

BUT YEAH INDEED IT'S MAYBE TOO SAD AND TOO YEAH TOO POIGNANT FOR
WELL IT'S A TRUE STORY ALSO UH SO
IT'S A TRUE STORY YEAH

YEAH
WELL
AND TO REMEMBER MAYBE OR
AND TO REMEMBER AS WELL YEAH
MM
BECAUSE IT WAS THIS THIS IS THE ONE ALREADY COMMENTED BY AGNES
SO I THINK I I WOULDN'T UH I DON'T WANT TO COMMENT IT AGAIN SO WE CAN JUST SKIP THAT
SO LET'S GO TO THE TO THE OTHER ONE
OKAY TH SO THE THIRD ONE IS THE USUAL SUSPECTS
IT'S A A THERE I THERE ARE SEVERAL S SEVERAL STORIES THAT ARE JUST MIXED UP DURING THE DURING THE MOVIE AND UH
IT'S A IT'S A CRIME AND DRAMA
I WOULD SAY THAT'S THAT'S LIKE A CLASSICAL MOVIES OF OF NINETIES UH IT'S UH DIRECTED BY QUENTIN TARANTINO

IF WOULD LIKE TO GO FOR SOMETHING WHAT IS REALLY SERIOUS I WOULD DEFINITELY UH GO FOR SCHINDLER'S LIST AND IF NOT UH THEN
HMM
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS UH SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION BECAUSE IT RECEIVE I YEAH IT IT NONE OF US SEEN THIS MOVIE UNFORTUNATELY
IT'S ACTUALLY I THINK IT'S A MOVIE WITH HIGHEST NUMBER OF THE VOTES YEAH IT IS
BUT UH AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE FROM YOUR FROM YOUR TABLE THERE IS A PLENTY OF VOTES
PROBABLY YEAH YOU RECEIVED SO YEAH
THE FIRST ONE YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
AND IT'S UH TIM ROBBINS AND UH WHO IS THE
MORGAN FREEMAN
YEAH GREAT ACTORS
THE GUY BEHI MORGAN FREEMAN
YEAH
MORGAN FREEMAN YEAH
YEAH BUT DIDN'T I MEAN I SEE THIS NAME OF THE THE DIRECTOR ON THE SLIDE BUT I DON'T REALLY KNOW HIM
FRANK DARABONT
MM-HMM
DARABONT
ME NEITHER ME NEITHER
MM YEAH
NEVER HEARD OF THIS GUY
YEAH BUT REALLY I WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THAT IT'S A IT'S A MOVIE WITH HIGHEST NUMBER OF THE VOTES AND THE HIGHEST RANKING AT THE SAME TIME
MM-HMM
OKAY
YEP
OKAY IT'S JUST A DO WE WANT TO HAVE TO DISPLAY THE MOST POPULAR MOVIE OR OR WE'RE
YEP IT TELLS SOMETHING
MM-HMM
SO
WELL LET'S GO THROUGH THE OTHER SUGGESTIONS
YEAH I'M NOT SURE
YEAH
AND ACTUALLY I DON'T THINK IT'S IT'S IT'S THAT POPULAR IN EUROPE AT LEAST BECAUSE I REALLY YOU SEE NONE OF US HAVE SEEN IT SO
YEAH
THAT'S RIGHT YEAH
MM-HMM
THOUGH IT'S A VERY USEFUL TABLE BUT UM OKAY DO YOU WANT ME TO YEAH
BUT IT'S TRUE YEAH WE SHOULDN'T STICK TO ONLY VERY HIGHLY RATED MOVIES ON THIS TABLE
YEAH MAYBE
OKAY ANDREI YEAH CAN CAN YOU COMMENT YOUR
SO ACTUALLY GIVEN THAT MORE OR LESS OUR THEME SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR WAS UM HISTORY DRAMA ACTION AND GIVEN ALSO THAT WELL
IF YOU CAN DISPLAY THEM IT'S PERFECT
UH YOU'RE WELCOME
UM I THOUGHT THAT AMONG THESE MOVIES WHO LOOK QUITE POPULAR UH SAVING PRIVATE RYAN WOULD BE A VERY GOOD CANDIDATE
I HAVE SOME PAPER COPIES
UM
SO YEAH UH I WROTE SOME NOTES ON UM ON SAVING PRIVATE RYAN WHICH IS MY CANDIDATE
UH DO YOU ALL HAVE A COPY OF THEM
WE DECIDED TO TO PRESENT THIS MONTH A MOVIE FROM THE THE NINETIES
YEAH
I DO
UM YEAH I W THANK YOU
YEAH YEAH
IT'S ABOUT SAVING ONE PERSON WHO HAS A SPECIAL SPECIAL VALUE IN THE IN THE MOVIE UM IF ONLY BECAUSE HIS BROTHERS ACTUALLY WERE ALL KILLED
SO UH THE GOVERNMENT BELIEVES THAT THEY SHOULD SAVE AT LEAST ONE PERSON FROM THE FAMILY
ACTUALLY IT'S A MOVIE I'VE SEEN
OKAY SO YOU'VE ALL SEEN IT SO MAYBE EVERYONE HAS SEEN IT I'M NOT VERY SURE
UM BUT I THINK IT'S A VERY NOVEL TREATMENT OF OF WAR
IT'S UH IT'S NO LONGER THE B GLORIFICATION OF UH WHATEVER COMBAT AND VICTORY BUT THE PLOT IS QUITE DIFFERENT
AND SAVING MEANS ACTUALLY REMOVING FROM THE THE FRONT IF YOU IF RE IF YOU REMEMBER THE PLOT
HAVE YOU SEEN IT BEFORE
YEAH
YEAH
YEP
BUT HERE THEY WELL YOU SEE EVERYTHING AND YOU SEE HOW MANY PEOPLE DIE ON THAT DAY
SO IT HAPPENS IN IN EUROPE JUST AFTER THE THE NORMANDY LANDING
SO HE IS SENT WITH THIS RATHER STRANGE MISSION WHICH IS NOT A COMBAT MISSION BUT THEY UH THEY WANT JUST TO TO GET THIS GUY BACK
AND IT'S VERY VERY STRIKING THE WAY THEY THEY FILMED ALL THE THE COMBAT SCENES AND UH IT'S IT'S VERY DRAMATIC
WHICH IS IN FACT THIS GUY IS I THINK BEHIND ENEMY LINES OR SOMETHING LIKE THIS
THE MAIN CHARACTER IS UH PLAYED BY TOM HANKS AND IT'S ACTUALLY YOU CAN SEE HIS PICTURE ON THE SECOND PAGE OF MY MY NOTES UH CAPTAIN JOHN MILLER
IT'S ACTUALLY
IT'S UH IT'S NOT YOU KNOW LIKE IN THE MOVIES FROM THE FIFTIES OR THE SIXTIES WHERE PEOPLE JUST FALL AND DIE ANONYMOUSLY
SO IN FACT THIS GUY THE PRIVATE RYAN IS NOT AT ALL THE MAIN ACTOR THE THE MAIN A WELL
MM-HMM
AND YOU E
UP CLOSE
AND YOU ENJOYED THAT THE FACT THE YOU SEE CLO I
YEAH
WELL I DIDN'T REALLY ENJOY TO SEE BAD THINGS BUT UH I THINK IT WAS SATISFYING TO SEE THAT WELL HOW DRAMATIC THINGS ARE
EXACTLY YEAH
I IT'S VERY MOVING I IT'S TRUE IT'S NOT VERY IT'S NOT VERY WELL HAPPY
I DON'T KNOW HOW IT WOULD COMPARE WITH APOCALYPSE NOW IF IT'S DARKER OR MAYBE
WELL IT'S VERY STRANGE YOU COULD S ASK THIS FOR ANY SAD MOVIE DID YOU ENJOY IT
TO REALISE HOW IT WA HOW IT WAS EXACTLY
YEAH
MM-HMM
IT'S VERY DIFFERENT I DON'T THINK YOU CAN COMPARE THEM
YEAH IT'S VERY DIFFERENT YEAH
QUITE A LOT OF VOTES SO UM ALSO ONE OF THE THE MAINSTREAM MOVIES
SO THE THE MOVIE IS RANKED QUITE HIGH IF I IF I REFER BACK TO YOUR TABLE IT'S NUMBER UH WHAT ACTUALLY UM FOURTEEN
UM ON THE SECOND PAGE UH OF MY NOTES I WELL I QUOTED SOME UH WELL SOME FACTS ABOUT THE MOVIE THAT I FOUND INTERESTING
IT'S TRUE THAT THE MOVIE IS NOT REALLY BLACK AND WHITE
UM ESPECIALLY I ENJOYED THE STORY ABOUT THE THE COLOUR SATURATION
UH BUT UH THE COLOURS ARE GREY ISH DARK ISH IT IT PROV IT MAKES A VERY MOVING EFFECT
WE WE COULD USE THEM FOR EITHER A POSTER OR UH OR A PRESENTATION
SO YEAH SO I THINK THIS WOULD CONTINUE A BIT OUR OUR THEME
YEAH
MM-HMM
TO MAKE IT LIKE UH AN HISTORICAL MOVIE OR
I THINK IT'S THE REFERENCE TO HISTORY AND ALSO THIS DARK YEAH THE MOOD AND UH THINGS ARE ACTUALLY WELL MOST OF THE THINGS ARE QUITE GREY
YOU KNOW THE UNIFORMS WEAPONS THINGS AND THINGS LIKE THAT
YEAH I THINK ALSO TO SHOW THE UM YEAH
ALSO SETS THE MOOD A LITTLE BIT
YEAH MM
DARKER AND
YEAH BUT YOU'D GET A DIFFERENT IMPRESSION IF YOU HAD BRIGHT BLUE SKY AND BRIGHT SUNSHINE BEHIND IT
MM-HMM
EXACTLY
BUT IF I READ YOUR FIRST POINT IN THE IN THIS UH TRIVIAS
AND THE REASON WAS THAT THEY WAN UH THAT THE THAT THE DIRECTOR WANTED THAT UH THE OTHER ACTORS WOULD RESENT HIM
WHY THIS WAS UH WANTED ACTUALLY
I AM JUST SURPRISED BECAUSE IT SAYS THAT ALL THE PRINCIPLE ACTORS UH UNDERWENT SEVERAL DAYS OF UH CRUEL ARMY TRAINING EXCEPT FOR THE MAN MATT DAMON
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
WELL I THINK MATT DAMON IS THE GUY WHO MUST BE SAVED IF I REMEMBER WELL AND IN FACT THE DIE
YEAH
YEAH HE'S PRIVATE RYAN
AND THEY DIDN'T LIKE IT THEY DIDN'T LIKE THE MISSION
WELL YEAH THE PEOPLE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY SHOULD SAVE ONE PERSON
WELL
THEY'RE BEING SENT TO THE FRONT BEHIND ENEMY LINES TO RETRIEVE ONE SOLDIER ONLY BECAUSE ALL OF HIS OTHER BROTHERS DIED
OH
ACTUALLY MOST OF THEM YEAH I THINK SO
SO AND THEY ARE QUITE RESENTFUL BECAUSE THEY I MEAN THEY FEEL THEY SHOULD FIGHT THEY SHOULDN'T JUST GO THERE AND UH JUST GET SOMEONE AND GET BACK
AND IN FACT SOME OF THEM D GET KILLED FOR THIS GUY
MM-HMM MM-HMM
YEAH AND IT OKAY
MOST OF THEM GET KILLED DON'T THEY
YEAH
SO THERE IS ACTUALLY SEVERAL PEOPLE DYING BECAUSE OF ONE SINGLE SINGLE SOLDIER MM-HMM
MOST OF THEM
YES
SO
YEAH
YEAH
IT'S A VERY I THINK SOME PEOPLE COMPARE IT WITH UH WHATEVER CHRISTIAN MESSAGE OR I DUNNO
YEAH YEAH
BUT UM I THINK IT'S QUITE QUITE UNIVERSAL AND IT'S UH I THINK IT'S A MODERN VERY MODERN
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
WHAT KIND OF MESSAGE
SORRY I'M NOT GETTING YOUR
BUT UH IF WE WANT TO KEEP THIS THIS IDEA OF HISTORY AND CONFLICT AND ALSO TO SHOW SOME SOME KIND OF MODERN TREATMENT OF IT
THE VALUE OF ONE IS COMPARED TO OTHERS I I DON'T KNOW I TH I THINK I HEARD THIS AT THAT POINT BUT MAYBE I'M JUST WRONG
WELL THIS UH VALUE OF ONE INDIVIDUAL IT LOOKS LIKE A CHRISTIAN MESSAGE YOU KNOW
SO YEAH I I THINK IT WOULD MAKE A COHERENT CHOICE
BUT IF YOU SEE IN MY NOTES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE FIRST PAGE I PUT SOME OTHER CANDIDATE MOVIES
IT IT WOULD MAKE FOR A GOOD CHOICE
IT'S PROBABLY A BIT LONG AND WE MIGHT WANT SOMETHING THAT IS LIGHTER AND FUNNIER
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
BUT QUITE WELL KNOWN MOVIES AND ENJOYABLE I WOULD SAY
SO DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS OR SHOULD WE JUST MOVE TO THE NEXT CANDIDATE MAYBE
UH LA VITA E BELLA IS AN ITALIAN ONE BUT IT'S ALSO ABOUT HISTORY AND IT HAPPENS AT T THE SAME PERIOD AS SCHINDLER'S LIST
AND I ALSO QUOTED PULP FICTION AND SILENCE OF THE LAMBS UM A BIT MORE REMOTE FROM THE THEMES
HMM
OR OR WE HAVE YOU HAVE
YEP
OKAY
I HAVE NO COMMENTS NO NO IT'S

AND THEY ALL ARE TOGETHER IN A BOWLING CLUB WHERE THEY MEET AND THEY DISCUSS ABOUT UH EVERYTHING
AND UH HE HAS A FRIEND COMI VETER VETERAN FROM VIETNAM AND UH ANOTHER FRIEND WHO IS NEVER SPEAKING
YEAH IT'S IT'S IT'S A BIT LIKE THE F IN MY OPINION LIKE UM AMERICAN BEAUTY
THEY SEEMS TO HAVE NO JOB I NOT KNOW WE NEVER SEEN I THEM WORKING
YEAH
BECAUSE IT'S IT'S A FUNNY MOVIE BUT UH IT CRITIQUES A LOT THE AMERICAN SOCIETY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
SO DOING NOTHING JUST UH TAKE IT EASY IN THE LIFE YEAH
AND ACTUALLY HE'S UH TAKING PART TO A KIND OF UM UH
MM-HMM
AND UH THE WHOLE STORY IS ABOUT UH HE WANTS TO TO TO GET SOME MONEY OUT OF THIS STORY
UH S SOME SOME KILLERS COME TO HIS APARTMENT UH BECAUSE THEY THINK HE'S SOMEONE ELSE
AND HE'S GOING TO SEE THE OTHER LEBOWSKI TO ASK HIM MONEY BECAUSE HE HE BECAUSE THE KILLERS ACTUALLY UH DAMAGE SOME STUFF IN HIS APARTMENT

AT THE BOTTOM WE CAN SEE THAT UM DO YOU KNOW MONDRE MONTREUX ENGLISH MOVIE CLUB
UH I SAID THAT PEOPLE CAN CONTACT US TO TO GET TO THE COMMITTEE AND SELECT MOVIES
MM
YEAH I LIKE THIS MM-HMM
MM-HMM YEAH
UH-HUH
YEAH THE TEXT ON THIS ONE IS VERY GOOD
SO UM
I THINK IT LOOKS TOO MUCH LIKE A C. D. COVER THOUGH
MM-HMM
OKAY
OH BECAUSE IT'S SQUARE
I LIKE THE LAYOUT OF THE FIRST ONE AND THE CONTENT OF THIS ONE
UH-HUH
SO PERHAPS WE CAN SOMEHOW COMBINE THEM
BUT THERE IS A TH THERE IS A THIRD ONE
UM ACTUALLY I I PREFER IT BECAUSE IT'S MORE COLOURFUL ALSO
IT LOOKS LIKE TWO DIFFERENT POSTERS THOUGH
THE F THE FIRST POSTER IS I THINK MUCH UH MUCH TOO DARK
YEAH I DON'T LIKE THE BLACK ONE
NOWADAYS YOU KNOW IF YOU SEE SOME ADVERTISEMENTS ON THE S YEAH BUT NOWADAYS IF YOU SEE SOME ADVERTISEMENT ON THE ON THE STREET
I THINK THERE IS TOO MANY COLOURS TOO MANY COLOURS
THIS IS TYPICAL TYPICAL UH POSTER I WOULDN'T WOULDN'T LOOK AT
NO THAT'S NICE
BUT IT'S IT CAN CATCH THE EYES ACTUALLY BUT UM
YEAH
IT'S HARD TO READ
YEAH
BUT UH I DON'T KNOW
BUT THEN THE PROBLEM I PREFERRED THE FIRST ONE BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE THE PLOT OF MOVIE
E ESPECIALLY FOR UH A MOVIE PEOPLE DON'T N NEVER HEARD ABOUT IT
MM-HMM
YEAH MAYBE TWO OR THREE SENTENCES BECAUSE I GUESS THEY WON'T STOP IN FRONT OF THE POSTER
MM-HMM

SO THE ON THE FIRST ON ON THE TOP YOU SEE THE HERO WITH A A COWBOY THAT I INTRODUCES THE MOVIE
OKAY SO JUST TO CONTI TO FINISH WITH THE BIG LEBOWSKI IT'S UM I THINK THOSE TWO IMAGES ARE PRETTY REPRESENTATIVE
