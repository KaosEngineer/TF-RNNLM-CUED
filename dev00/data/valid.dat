OKAY
SHE GONNA ANSWER ME OR NOT
YEAH I'VE GOT
RIGHT BOTH OF THEM OKAY
YES
GOD
JESUS IT'S GONNA FALL OFF
YEP YEP
OKAY
OKAY
HELLO EVERYBODY
UM I'M SARAH THE PROJECT MANAGER AND THIS IS OUR FIRST MEETING SURPRISINGLY ENOUGH
OKAY THIS IS OUR AGENDA UM
OKAY
TU TU TU TU
HI GOOD MORNING
UM THEN WE'LL GO DO TOOL TRAINING TALK ABOUT THE PROJECT PLAN
DISCUSS OUR OWN IDEAS AND EVERYTHING UM AND WE'VE GOT TWENTY FIVE MINUTES TO DO THAT AS FAR AS I CAN UNDERSTAND
WE WILL DO SOME STUFF GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER A BIT BETTER TO FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE WITH EACH OTHER
UM WE WANT IT TO BE ORIGINAL SOMETHING THAT'S UH PEOPLE HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF
THAT'S NOT OUT IN THE SHOPS UM TRENDY APPEALING TO A WIDE MARKET
UM CONCEPTUAL DESIGN
OKAY UM FIRST IS THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN UM THIS IS WHERE WE ALL GO OFF AND DO OUR INDIVIDUAL WORK
UM WHAT NEEDS NEED TO BE FULFILLED BY THE PRODUCT UM WHAT EFFECTS THE PRODUCT HAS TO HAVE AND HOW IT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO DO THAT
NOW WE'RE DEVELOPING A REMOTE CONTROL WHICH YOU PROBABLY ALREADY KNOW
BUT YOU KNOW NOT A HUNK OF METAL AND USER FRIENDLY GRANNIES TO KIDS MAYBE EVEN POOCHES SHOULD BE ABLE TO USE IT
WHAT WE'RE THINKING HOW IT'S GONNA GO AND THEN THE DETAILED DESIGN HOW WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA PUT IT INTO PRACTICE AND MAKE IT WORK
'KAY
SO
WE'RE GONNA PRACTICE WITH THE PENS AND DRAW OUR FAVOURITE ANIMAL ON THE WHITE BOARD I'LL GO FIRST AND UM SUM UP THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THAT ANIMAL
OKAY RIGHT
OOPS
OKAY I'LL LEAVE SPACE FOR EVERYONE ELSE
UM
WHAT'S MISSING
WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF BLUE
OKAY
I'M NOT GONNA ASK YOU TO GUESS I'M GOING TO TELL YOU THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A TIGER

THANKS
ALRIGHT OKAY
WELL SINCE YOU GUYS HAVE CHOSEN THE ONES I WANTED TO DO I'LL HAVE TO HAVE TO GO FOR SOMETHING A BIT RANDOM
DOES IT LOOK LIKE A DOG ACTUALLY
OKAY
AND ALSO MY DRAWING SKILL ISN'T THAT GREAT SO YEAH
WELL AS YOU CAN SEE THE QUALITY OF THE WORK TODAY IS UM
MM
I THINK IT'S OUTSTANDINGLY GOOD
OKAY NOW I'M GONNA HAVE TO CHANGE WHAT IS WAS ORIGINALLY GONNA BE BECAUSE THAT LOOKS LIKE A BEAK NOW SO
WELL IT WAS IT WAS AN AT FIRST FIRSTLY IT WAS AN ATTEMPT AT A T. REX AND THEN IT SORT OF CHANGED INTO A PELICAN BUT IT CAN BE A CROCODILE NOW ACTUALLY
YEAH IT CAN BE A CROCODILE IT CAN BE A CROCODILE
CROCODILE
GONNA BE A BIRD
IS IT GONNA BE IT'S GONNA BE A BIRD
O
THAT'S LOVELY
YEAH AND UH I'LL HAVE TO THINK ON THE SPOT OF UH THINGS THAT IT IS
UM
BEAUTI THAT'S
UH SCARY
UH STRONG
YEAH THAT'S ABOUT IT I THINK
OKAY IT'S FINE
OKAY
OOPS THIS IS NOW COMING APART LET ME JUST PUT THE TOP IN
UM I'M VERY IMPRESSED WITH YOUR ARTISTIC SKILLS MINE'S ARE DREADFUL
UH UH
WO
I HOPE THAT CLICKS IN I'LL JUST I'LL HOLD IT ON OKAY
OOPS OH DEAR WHAT HAPPENED THERE
TECHNICAL HELP
HOPEFULLY THAT'LL STAY ON TWO HANDED VERSION
OKAY UH
HMM
OKAY
AGAIN THIS IS OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD I WAS GONNA DO A BIG CAT TOO UM
UH
OH DEAR IT DOESN'T LOOK WHAT LIKE WHAT I WANT IT TO BE
HMM
S
UH
UH
IT'S NOT A VAMPIRE BAT HONESTLY
OKAY YEAH
THAT'S MY DREADFUL THAT'S THE WORST YET
THAT'S IT'S MEANT TO BE AN EAGLE YOU CAN TELL IT'S A FLYING ANIMAL COULD HAVE BEEN A SEAGULL I NEVER THOUGHT OF A SEAGULL
I SUPPOSE THEY'RE ALL SO INDEPENDENT I'D PUT THAT ONE DOWN AGAIN
AN EAGLE UM AGAIN I'M THINKING ON MY FEET GOODNESS
DA DUM UM
UH AND SOMEWHERE THERE'S A BODY BEHIND
OKAY SOME SORT OF BIRD
A SEAGU RIGHT NOT A SEAGULL
AH EAGLE RIGHT OKAY
EAGLE OKAY
THEY'RE GOOD AT GOLF
ARE THEY
OH RIGHT OKAY I'M NOT GOOD AT GOLF
I'D SAY THEY'RE QUITE FREE SPIRITED FLYING AROUND EVERYWHERE DOING THEIR OWN THING
OH
INDEPEN INDEPENDENT RIGHT DID YOU SAY THEY'RE GOOD AT GOLF
EAGLE
YEAH NO YEAH AN EAGLE
AND UH BIRDS OF PREY AREN'T THEY OH DEAR INTREPID
I'LL PUT THAT INTREPID
MM-HMM
THERE WE GO HOPE THAT PEN'S GONNA BE OKAY
THAT'S LOVELY
WHOOPS
OKAY
THAT WAS FUN RIGHT
ANY IDEAS
UM FINANCE WISE WE'VE GOT A SELLING PRICE AT TWENTY FIVE EUROS WHICH I DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT THAT IS IN POUNDS AT ALL
IT'S ABOUT MM MM YEAH
SEVENTEEN
ONE POINT FOUR OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
ONE POINT FOUR EURO WOULD MAKE A POUND OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
YEAH YEAH SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO THAT YEAH ABOUT SEVENTEEN SEVENTEEN POUNDS SOMETHING LIKE THAT
YEAH
SEVENTEEN
OKAY THAT'S EXPENSIVE
D FIFTEEN
SEVENTEEN POUNDS
WE CAN JUST REFER TO THIS LATER CAN'T WE
SHOULD WE BE MAKING NOTES OF THIS
YEAH OKAY
BUT
I THINK SO I THINK SO I'LL BE ABLE TO UM PULL IT UP OR I COULD PUT IT IN THE SHARED FOLDER OR SOMETHING
OKAY
SO IT'D STILL BE YEAH WE HAD TO BUY ONE
HAVI HAVING SAID THAT THOUGH IF YOU WANNA GET ONE OF THOSE THE THE ONES ON THE MARKET AT THE MOMENT THEY'RE S THEY'RE ABOUT TWENTY POUNDS ANYWAY
RIGHT
REALLY
SO
MM
SO I SUPPOSE LATER IT DEPENDS IF WE WANT TO UNDERCUT THE PRICE WE D OR OR IS IT GOING TO MAKE OUR PRODUCT LOOK A CHEAPIE CHEAPIE OPTION
I THINK
YEAH UM PRODUCTION COST'S AT TWELVE FIFTY SO
HMM
OKAY PRETTY HUGE MARGIN
UM AND PROFIT AIM IS FIFTY MILLION EUROS WHICH IS UH
HALF OF THE SELLING PRICE IS TAKEN UP BY BUILDING IT
YEAH
MM
MM-HMM
IN OUR FIRST YEAR
YI YES UM YEAH I PRESUME SO
UM
MM-HMM
SO THEN
YOU'VE GOT MARKET RANGE INTERNATIONAL AND YOU DID SAY EARLIER IT'S GOT TO BE A UM ACCESSIBLE AND USABLE BY SORT OF ALL AGE GROUPS JUST T WE'RE NOT FOCUSING ON BUSINESS MARKET
OKAY
ANY PARTICULAR THING IT'S EVERYONE USER FRIENDLY TO EVERYONE
MM-HMM
NO YEAH
BIG TARGET GROUP
OKAY
UM MAKING THAT A KEY POINT JUST THAT IT'S GOING TO BE IN THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET LIKE AUSTRALIA AMERICA THINGS LIKE THAT
SO YES YES I DON'T THINK WE HAVE TO I DON'T THINK IT'S A CASE OF WORRYING ABOUT DIFFERENT LANGUAGES AND THINGS LIKE THAT
NO
MM
BUT THAT WAS QUITE GOOD THE FACT THAT YOU COULD
A T. V. AND A SORT OF AMP THING ALL SET UP SO WE GOT ONE OF THE UNIVERSAL REMOTE CONTROLS
WHAT ARE YOUR EXPERIENCES WITH REMOTE CONTROLS
I THINK IT WAS QUITE A CHEAPIE AS WELL SO THAT MIGHT HAVE HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT
UM THAT YOU PROGRAMME EACH OF YOUR THINGS INTO BUT THAT KEPT LOSING THE SIGNALS SO WE'D HAVE TO RE PROGRAMME IT EVERY NOW AND AGAIN
I MEAN I'VE GOT WE GOT UM WE HAD THREE VIDEOS
MM-HMM
YEAH
ALRIGHT
YEAH
YEAH THAT C
MM-HMM
YEAH UH
USE ALL THE ONES AT THE SAME TIME
YOU DIDN'T HAVE SIX REMOTE CONTROLS SITTING IN FRONT OF YOU
RIGHT
OKAY YOU WANNA INTEGRATE EVERYTHING INTO ONE LIKE
YEAH 'CAUSE YOU
BUT BASICALLY ON OFF VOLUME UP AND DOWN CHANNEL ONE TWO TH THAT BASIC FUNCTIONS
NOT DOING ANY TAMPERING WITH IT AND PROGRAMMING USING IT TO PROGRAMME T. V. AND UH UH VIDEOS AND THINGS
MY EXPERIENCE HAS ONLY BEEN BEING GIVEN THE REMOTE CONTROL WITH THE OBJECT I BUY
I DON'T THINK I COULD GO ANY FURTHER WITH IT THAN THAT SO I SUPPOSE IT'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING USABLE BY SOMEONE LIKE ME AS WELL
MM-HMM
OKAY
MM
I MEAN AND YOU DON'T WANT TO I HATE I HATE LOOKING AT A CONTROL AND SEEING A MILLION TINY LITTLE BUTTONS WITH TINY LITTLE WORDS SAYING WHAT THEY ALL DO AND JUST SITTING THERE SEARCHING FOR THE TELETEXT BUTTON OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
YEAH THE MAIN THAT'S THE MAIN STUFF ANYWAY
MM-HMM
MM
YEAH
AND SYMBOLS THAT YOU DON'T NECESSARILY UNDERSTAND SYMBOLS YOU'RE MEANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT YOU DON'T
MM
YEAH
UM
SO SIMPLIFICATION OF SYMBOLS YOU COULD THINK OF
'CAUSE IT DOESN'T MAKE WHEN YOU PICK IT UP IT DOESN'T MAKE IT REALLY COMPLICATED TO LOOK AT IT'S OBVIOUS WHAT YOU'RE DOING UM
WHEN THEY'RE WHEN YOU'VE GOT THE MAIN THINGS ON THE FRONT OF IT AND A SECTION OPENS UP OR SOMETHING TO THE OTHER FUNCTIONS WHERE YOU CAN DO SOUND OR OPTIONS KIND OF RECORDING
THINGS LIKE THAT INSIDE IT
OH YEAH
MM-HMM
MM
MM-HMM
MM
ACTUALLY THAT JUST RAISES A POINT I WONDER WHAT OUR DESIGN PEOPLE THINK
BUT YOU KNOW ON A MOBILE PHONE YOU CAN PRESS A KEY AND IT GIVES YOU A MENU
IT'S GOT A MENU DISPLAY I WONDER IF INCORPORATING THAT INTO THE DESIGN OF A REMOTE CONTROL MIGHT BE USEFUL SO YOU'VE GOT A LITTLE L. C. D. DISPLAY
MM-HMM
MENU ALRIGHT
YEAH
UH UH
MAY H MAYBE HAVE AN L. C. D. DI DISPLAY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT LIKE A MOBILE YEAH AND WITH MENUS
AND IF IT'S S SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU HAVE ON MOBILE PHONE PEOPLE MIGHT FIND IT EASIER TO BROWSE AND NAVIGATE ALSO MAYBE
RIGHT I WAS THINKING ON THE SAME LINES YOU INSTEAD OF HAVING TOO MANY B BUTTONS AND MAKE IT COMPLICATED FOR THE USER
WITH MENUS YEAH YEAH
YEAH
WHAT ABOUT THE OLDER GENERATION
WHAT ABOUT GRANNY AND GRANDADS
YOU MEAN TO SAVE IT LESSER NUMBER
UM MY GRANDAD CAN ANSWER HIS MOBILE PHONE BUT HE COULDN'T EVEN DREAM OF TEXTING OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
YEAH
CAN HE PROGRAMME HIS REMOTE CONTROL OR IS IT BASIC WITH THAT TOO
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
RIGHT
I DON'T THINK THEY TAPE THINGS I DON'T THINK THEY USE
YEAH MY GRANDAD'S ACTUALLY BETTER THAN ME AT USING TELETEXT SO
RIGHT
RIGHT
THAT'S GONNA BE A PROBLEM ANYWAY WITH THE OLDER GENERATION PERHAPS AND THAT'S ANOTHER ISSUE HOW WE TACKLE THAT
SO THAT'S A PROBLEM REGARDLESS OF OF ANY DESIGN MODIFICATIONS YOU YOU COME UP WITH
YEAH
MM YEAH THE AGE GAP
YEAH WHAT IT JUST NEEDS TO BE AS LONG AS IT'S SORT OF SELF INTUITIVE AND YOU CAN CAN WORK OUT
WHAT EVERYTHING'S DOING 'CAUSE I MEAN
MENUS ON SORT OF NEW PHONES NOW THEY'VE SORT OF GOT ALL THESE PICTURES AND STUFF WHICH MAKES IT FAIRLY OBVIOUS WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO
MM
MM-HMM
I DON'T KNOW I D I DON'T LIKE THE YOU KNOW THE NEW PHONES THAT HAVE KIND OF GOT A WINDOWS BASED RUNNING SYSTEM
BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW
OH YEAH
MM-HMM
I FIND IT REALLY CONFUSING I KEPT GETTING LOST IN THE PHONE
I DI I'VE NOT GOT A NEW ONE BUT UH MY FRIEND GOT A NEW ONE AND I WAS TRYING TO DO THINGS WITH IT AND I JUST KEPT GETTING LOST
BUT
RIGHT
THAT'S JUST ME
YEAH I DON'T I DON'T KNOW HOW FOR TWENTY FI OR TWELVE EUROS FIFTY HOW MUCH OF A EXCELLENT SCREEN YOU COULD GET
YOU'D YOU'D HAVE TO SORT OF KEEP IT DOWN TO A BLACK AND WHITE L. C. D. THING ANYWAY I'D ASSUME
YEAH
MM-HMM
OBVIOUSLY IT DISPLAYS LESS ON THE SCREEN IT DISPLAYS LESS ON THE SCREEN BUT AS LONG AS THEY CAN READ IT THAT'S THE MAIN THING
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THAT FOR THE OLDER GENERATION YOU COULD HAVE LIKE AN EXTRA BUTTON THAT YOU PRESS FOR LARGE PRINT LIKE YOU DO IN LARGE PRINT BOOKS
OKAY
TELETEXT HAS GOT THAT OPTION AS WELL
YEAH
IN THAT YOU'VE GOT THE BASIC BUTTONS JUST FOR YOUR PLAY VOLUME PROGRAMME THINGS AND ALSO AND THEN A MENU TO GO INTO WITH OBVIOUS PICTURES
OBVIOUS SYMBOLS AND THAT'S WHERE YOU CONTROL RECORDING AND THINGS LIKE THAT
OR WHAT ABOUT KIND OF A DUAL FUNCTION
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM
THE OTHER THING IS JUST CH CHUCKING INTO MOBILE PHONE F DESIGN FEATURES AGAIN
IT COULD HAVE A FLIP TOP REMOTE CONTROL SO THAT WHEN YOU FLIP OVER THE TOP
YOUR SCREEN IS YOU CAN HAVE A BIGGER SCREEN IN THE THE FLIP OVER
MM-HMM
MM OKAY
I THINK THAT'S A COST THING I DON'T I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH WE'RE GONNA KNOW ABOUT
S
Y
BUT IT MIGHT HAVE ITS COST IMPLICATIONS
IT MIGHT IT MIGHT SAVE A B BIT OF SPACE IT'S I INSTEAD OF LOOKING BULKY IT MIGHT LOOK SMALL
YEAH
MM-HMM
YES NO THAT'S IMPORTANT
YEAH LIKE SMALLER
YEAH
OKAY
AND THERE'S NO REASON WE NEED TO MAKE IT LOOK AS FASHIONABLE AND STYLISH AS A MOBILE PHONE IT CAN STILL BE LIGHTWEIGHT PLASTIC YOU KNOW
SORRY I'M TREADING ON YOUR TERRITORY GUYS
SOMETHING THAT'S EASILY MOULDED AND PRODUCED
MM
RIGHT
YEAH
NO UH UH
UM
UM RIGHT OKAY WE'VE GOT HALF AN HOUR BEFORE THE NEXT MEETING SO WE'RE ALL GONNA GO OFF AND DO OUR INDIVIDUAL THINGS
I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY ABOUT IT AND THEN WE'LL COME BACK AND LIAISE AGAIN AND I GET TO DO ANOTHER FANTASTIC POWERPOINT PRESENTATION
SO I THINK THINK THE WHOLE DESIGN THING MIGHT BE QUI I MEAN YOU DON'T YOU YOU CAN STILL HAVE PLASTIC AND IT'D LOOK QUITE GOOD BUT
YEAH
JUST JUST A QUICK THING ABOUT THE UM ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT THE UH DOES DOES IT NEED TO BE FASHIONABLE
THE SORT OF I I HAD A QUICK LOOK AT THE COMPANY WEBSITE AND IT'S LIKE THE THE UH WE PUT THE FASHION INTO ELECTRONICS
SURE
AH RIGHT
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
SURE B Y YEAH
YEAH YEAH YEAH
YOU KNOW TH THAT WAS MY MAIN POINT WE DON'T HAVE TO USE METAL
I DON'T KNOW IF USING PLASTIC DOES MAKE IT CHEAPER I PRESUME IT WOULD
BUT YEAH I MEAN IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THAT
YEAH
MM
YEAH
YEAH
I WOULD IT WOULD PROBABLY
WHICH LOOKS A BIT SMARTER SO YEAH I GUESS THAT'S STUFF WE CAN THINK ABOUT
OKAY SO LET'S BREAK IT UP THERE
I MEAN THERE'S SKY REMOTE CONTROLS AND EVERYTHING
THEY'RE KIND OF MOULDED AND LOOK A BIT DIFFERENT AND THE TELEWEST REMOTE CONTROLS ARE SILVER PLASTIC
RIGHT
OKAY
'KAY
SO SEE YOU IN HALF AN HOUR
OKAY
OKAY
DO WE GO BACK TO OUR ROOM
YEP
I THINK SO YEAH
MM YEAH
HELP
IT'S UP THERE
THAT SCREEN'S BLACK
ALRIGHT OKAY
OKAY THAT'S FINE
OH GOD
ARE WE DONE
UM RIGHT OUR AGENDA FOR TODAY DO YOU WANT US TO GIVE YOU A SECOND
RIGHT OKAY UM THIS IS OUR SECOND MEETING AND I MIGHT BE A BIT ALL OVER THE PLACE
UH NO THAT'S OKAY SORRY
OKAY UM
I'LL GO OVER WHAT WE DECIDED LAST MEETING
MM-HMM
UM
WE DECIDED UPON A UNIVERSAL CONTROL ONE HANDSET FOR ALL T. V. VIDEO
UM OUR BUDGET WOULD HAVE TO AFFECT UM TRY NOT TO REFLECT OUR BUDGET UM THAT WE MIGHT
UM THAT IT WAS IMPORTANT THAT THE PRODUCT WAS ACCESSIBLE TO A WIDE RANGE OF CONSUMERS WIDE AGE RANGE NOT LIMITING ANYONE
WE DECIDED IT WAS IMPORTANT TO REFLECT THE COMPANY'S IMAGE IN OUR PRODUCT WE PUT FASHION IN ELECTRONICS YOU KNOW THAT KIND OF S THING
EQUIPMENT
SORRY
UM
HAVE A BIT OF OH OH YOU CAN SEE IT OKAY
UM DISSONANCE BETWEEN WHAT OUR BUDGET WAS AND WHAT WE WANT IT TO LOOK LIKE
WE DISCUSSED A FLIP OPEN DESIGN UM REDUCING THE SIZE OF THE CONTROL AND AN ELECTRONIC PANEL UM FOR FURTHER FEATURES LIKE PROGRAMMING THINGS LIKE THAT
WANT IT TO LOOK UNCLUTTERED UNDAUNTING TO THE CUSTOMER
UM THREE PRESENTATIONS I'VE GOT WRITTEN HERE SO
OKAY
SHALL WE HEAR FROM MARKETING FIRST
UM IS IT OKAY IF I POSTPONE THAT TIL LATER I JUST WANT TO GET ACCESS TO A LITTLE BIT MORE INFORMATION IS THAT OKAY
NO THAT'S FINE THAT'S FINE
CAN I GRAB THE
OKAY YEAH I'LL GO FIRST
UNPLUG ME
THANKS
WHAT DO I HAVE TO PRESS
OH F. EIGHT
UM F. N.
FUNCTION F. EIGHT
OH RIGHT YEAH
OKAY
MAYBE
YEP
YEP THERE WE GO
OKAY THIS IS UH THE WORKING DESIGN PRESENTED BY ME THE UH INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER EXTRAORDINAIRE
'KAY THIS IS WHERE I WENT A BIT MAD WITH POWERPOINT SO
WHAT THE FIRST THING QUESTION I ASKED WAS WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO DESIGN
WHETHER THAT BE THE POWER OR THE CHANNEL UM OR THE VOLUME
EVERYTHING IS JUST UM SOME SORT OF SIGNAL TO CHANGE THE STATE OF THE T. V. OR OTHER APPLIANCE THAT IT'S SENDING THE SIGNAL TO
WELL A DEVICE WHICH BASICALLY JUST SENDS THE SIGNAL TO THE T. V. TO CHANGE ITS STATE
UM SO I DECIDED I'D HAVE A LOOK AT WHAT TH OTHER PEOPLE HAVE DESIGNED AND TRY AND TAKE SOME INSPIRATION FROM THAT
BUT UH ALTHOUGH WE WILL WANT TO BE TAKING
IDEAS FROM OTHER PEOPLE WE WANNA MAKE SURE THAT OUR DESIGN STANDS OUT AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WELL IT WASN'T REALLY MY AREA BECAUSE
SO UM YEAH I RAN OUT OF TIME SO I COULDN'T DO THIS ONE AS FUN AS THE LAST ONE
YEAH SURE
I'M I'M NOT SURE WHETHER WE WANT TO LOOK AT THE SIZE ISSUE BECAUSE MOST OF THEM ARE POWERED BY TRIPLE A. BATTERIES BUT THOSE CAN BE QUITE BULKY SO I D I DIDN'T KNOW IF YOU WANTED TO LOOK AT SOMETHING ELSE UM SO WE COULD SHRINK DOWN THE SIZE OF THE CONTROL
WIRELESS AND YOU DON'T NEED TO SEND VERY MUCH INFORMATION
UM MOST OF THEM ARE POWERED BY SOME FORM OF BATTERY
UM AND UH I FOUND OUT THAT MOST UH CONTROLS USE SOME FORM OF INFRARED TO SEND SIGNALS TO THE T. V. PRESUMABLY BECAUSE OF THE COST ISSUE OF UH SOMETHING LIKE UH THE SAME THING THAT COMPUTERS USE
NOW OUR ONE
I'M DEALING WITH THE INSIDE REALLY
MM-HMM
COULD I CAN I INTERJECT TO ASK A QUESTION THERE IS THAT APPROPRIATE
YOU'RE SAYING THE TRIPLE A. BATTERIES ARE SMALL OR THE SURROUNDING IT
MM-HMM
IF YOU IF YOU LOOK AT IF YOU LOOK AT MOST REMOTE CONTROLS THEY'RE QUITE THEY'RE QUITE CHUNKY AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THE BATTERIES
UM AND D WHICH LEADS SORT OF ONTO THE NEXT POINT ABOUT 'EM BEING SMALL AND EASY TO CARRY ROUND
UM NOW THE ONES AT THE MOMENT ARE SMALL BUT I WAS JUST WONDERING IF WE COULD LOOK AT SOMETHING A BIT SMALLER
UM NO NO
YEAH THE THE WELL YOU CAN YOU CAN GET THE SORT OF CIRCULAR ROUND ONES BUT I'M JUST WONDERING ABOUT POWER CONSUMPTION AND HOW MUCH YOU NEED TO SEND THE DATA ACROSS
THEY HAVE TO BE OBVIOUSLY THIS CERTAIN SIZE TO FIT THOSE BATTERIES IN
MM-HMM
RIGHT THE TRIPLE A. S ARE THE SMALLEST YOU CAN GET ARE THEY NOT RIGHT
THEY ARE
OKAY
OH I SEE
OKAY
NOW THE MAIN COMPONENTS I CAME UP WITH UM WERE OBVIOUSLY THE POWER SOURCE FOR THE BATTERIES 'CAUSE OTHERWISE IT'S NOT GONNA WORK
NOW THESE HAVE A WIRELESS RANGE OF UP TO ABOUT FIVE METRES WHICH IS SORT OF SUITABLE FOR ANYONE WHO'S WATCHING THE T. V. UNLESS THEY'RE IN A CINEMA
WHICH NOT MOST PEOPLE DO SO AS WE'RE APPLYING TO THE MOST AUDIENCE THAT SHOULD BE FINE
WE CAN UH DISCUSS THAT LATER AND THEN YOU OBVIOUSLY NEED SOMETHING TO DECODE THE INFORMATION THAT YOU'RE PUTTING IN FROM FROM THE CONTROLLER AND TO TURN IT INTO AN I UH INFRARED SIGNAL WHICH WE'RE GOING TO USE TO SEND THE INFORMATION
UH AS I SAID ABOUT THE W WHICH BATTERIES WE WERE GONNA CHOOSE
AND THEN I WAS UH JUST HAD A QUICK LOOK AT THE EXTERNAL DESIGN BUT I D I LEFT THAT MOSTLY TO THE UH INTERFACE DESIGNER
WE'VE JUST GOT THE THE POWER GOING TO THE INFRARED BULB WITH THE CHIP AND THE UH U. I. INTERFACE UM
IT'S NOT A PROPER CIRCUIT I'M NOT SURE IF IT'D WORK OR NOT
AND SO THIS IS WHAT I HAD AS THE BASIC IDEA OF WHAT WE WANNA DO
I'M NOT EVEN CONFIDENT THAT THOSE ARE THE REAL UM THE REAL WAY YOU'D WIRE IT UP BUT ANYWAY
WHEN YOU WHEN YOU PRESSED ANYTHING IT WOULD THE CHIP WOULD CONVERT IT INTO SOME FORM OF I. R. DATA WHICH COULD BE DECODED BY THE T. V. RECEIVER
WHICH OBVIOUSLY MEANS THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO CONFORM TO WHATEVER
WHICH WOULD BASICALLY
UH BECAUSE THEY'RE SMALL THEY'RE ALSO EASY TO LOSE SO IF WE COULD LOOK INTO SOME WAY OF D DUNNO SOME ANTI GOING DOWN THE SIDE OF THE SOFA THING THAT YOU COULD HAVE
UM WE WANT UH THE IT TO BE AVAILABLE TO A WIDE AUDIENCE AT A LOW COST SO ALL THE COMPONENTS THAT I'VE PUT FORWARD ARE UH LOW IN COST SO THAT THAT SHOULD BE GOOD
UM WHATEVER FORM OF COMMUNICATION THAT THE T. V. S ARE ALREADY USING AND SINCE THAT THAT'S ANOTHER USE AND REASON TO USE THAT INFRARED BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT ALL T. V. S USE AT THE MOMENT
I TH THAT WAS JUST SORT OF A GENERAL POINT THERE
AND THEN FINALLY
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT IT BEFORE AND ALSO JUST SOMETHING THAT I WAS THINKING ABOUT
UM IT SHOULD SHOULD BE DIFFERENT ENOUGH UM FROM THE ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS TO GET A GOOD CONSUMER BASE
AND THAT'S UH YEAH
MM
MM
THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT PART IT CAME UP IN OUR MARKET RESEARCH FINDINGS TOO SO I CAN REFER TO THAT WHENEVER YOU LIKE ME TO PRESENT
MM
ALRIGHT OKAY AND YEAH THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I CAME UP WITH THERE SO IF YOU WANNA
UM WOULD YOU LIKE TO CONTINUE ON FROM THAT
OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH
YEP
OOH
IT CAN BE OKAY THAT'S OKAY WITH ME
'KAY
OR MAYBE MOVE THE LAPTOP OVER
FURTHER
OOPS
F. EIGHT RIGHT
WHY'S IT NOT WORKING
F. FUNCTION
FUNCTION F. EIGHT YEAH
OKAY
MM WHY'S IT IN THE RIGHT
NO
THE PLUG HASN'T COME OUT AT THE BOTTOM HAS IT
NO
YEAH IT'S CONNECTING
NO NO YEAH IT'S JUST
METER ADJUSTING
OKAY
OH THERE
JUST A COUPLE OF VALUABLE POINTS AND STARTED DEVELOPING ON THAT AND THERE MIGHT BE SOME MISSING LOOPS IN THIS THING WHICH I THINK WE'LL UH TAKE A FEEDBACK FROM THE MARKETING BECAUSE
ACTUALLY MM SOME OF MY POINTS MIGHT OVERLAP WITH WHAT WILLIAM'S JUST MENTION BUT BASICALLY MY METHOD WAS LIKE UH WHATEVER BRAINSTORMING WE DID IN THE LAST MEETING
YEAH
YEAH
SO PURPOSE AS WILLIAM ALREADY SAID I WOULD PUT IT TO SIMPLIFY THE INTERACTION WITH T. V. TO MAKE MAKE IT AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE
AND TO SUMMARISE I I WOULD SAY IT'S IT SHOULD BE USER FRIENDLY BY BEING EASY TO USE
UM I HAVEN'T HAD SOME MARKETING DATA AND BASICALLY EVERY PRODUCT IS MARKETABLE
RATHER THAN HAVING A LOT OF COMPLEX BUTTON BECAUSE YOU CAN HAVE AN ENGINEERING MAYBE HAVING HUNDRED BUTTONS AND MAYBE HAVING UH A REMOTE CONTROL WHICH HAS THE MAIN FEATURES
LIKE VOLUME CONTROL OR CHANNEL CH CHANGING THE CHANNEL OR WHATEVER
THE MAIN FUNCTIONS SUCH AS WHICH ARE LIKE OFTEN USED WILL BE ON THE TOP AND THE COMPLEX FUNCTIONS WHICH SAY YOU YOU CAN SAY LIKE THE Y YOUNG GENERATION OR TRENDY GENERATION WANT TO PR SAY PROGRAMME THEIR FAVOURITE CHANNELS OR WHATEVER
CAN BE PUT IN THE MIDDLE PART OF THE F FLIP TOP
BUT WE ARE TO TO MAKE IT UNIQUE SO THAT PEOPLE WANT TO BUY IT WILL THIS TWO FEATURES TOGETHER
SO WHAT THE CONCEPT IS TO HAVE A FLIP TOP MODEL
SO IT'S LIKE IT COULD BE ACCESSED BY A WIDE RA RANGE OF UH AUDIENCE AND WE CAN PUNCH IN NEW F FEATURES SUCH AS UH ADDED FEATURES SUCH AS SHOCK PROOF BODY AND MAYBE A DESIGN TO APPEAL TO A LOT OF PEOPLE
FINDINGS MOST PEOPLE PREFER US USER FRIENDLY RATHER THAN COMPLEX REMOTE CONTROLS BECAUSE THERE ARE TIMES LIKE UH PEOPLE HAVE USED A REMOTE CONTROL FOR SAY A YEAR OR SOMETHING AND THEY THEY ARE NOT USED MAYBE THIRTY TO FORTY PERCENT OF THE BUTTONS SO IT'S NOT OF NO USE OF PUNCHING IN THE UH TRYING TO PUT IN THOSE THINGS IN ON THE TOP OF THE REMOTE CONTROL AND TRY TO CONFUSE THE USER
AS WE SAW WE WE HAVE TO MAKE A PROFIT ALSO SO WE WE CAN MAYBE GO FOR AN ECONOMIES OF A HIGHER PRODUCTION MM BY FIFTY MILLION WE SAID
YEAH WITH THAT I THINK WE'LL BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE ECONOMIES OF SCALE ALSO SO WE CAN GIVE IN ADD IN MORE FEATURES AND MAKE IT LESS COSTLY
YEAH
UM
THAT'S SO THIS IS IF YOU ASK ME PERSONALLY I WOULD MAKE UH
SO IN OVERALL A SIMPLE AND UH
FLIP TOP WITH A TRENDY UH UH DESIGN AND S MAYBE WE WE SHOULD LOOK AT ALSO LIKE THE BUTTONS WHE WHETHER THEY ARE LIKE SOFT OR LITTLE HARD BECAUSE THEY ARE TIMES WHEN THE BUTTONS TEND TO BE A BIT HARD AFTER UH CONTINUOUS USE USAGE AND ALL THAT
YEAH
USER FRIENDLY DESIGN
MM
UH ANY COMMENTS LIKE IF YOU WANT
'KAY
UM I THINK WE'LL CHAT ABOUT IT AT THE END
OKAY SO IF ANYONE WANTS TO WRITE SOMETHING DOWN THAT THEY WANT TO BRING UP AT THE END UM
OKAY
'KAY
YEAH SURE
OOH IT'S VIBRATING THAT'S STRANGE
OH GOD
RIGHT OKAY
DOES IT MATTER
HAVE I GOT TO KEEP THIS HERE
I THINK YOU'LL HAVE TO
YOU CAN'T
IT'LL HAVE TO THIS CAN'T BE PULLED
UH WHOOPS
WILL IT MANAGE
I'LL HAVE T I'LL HAVE TO MOVE IT WON'T I
BIT MORE OH DEAR
WE JUST DO THE BEST WE CAN
YOU'LL HAVE TO PUSH IT A BIT MORE
YEP
YEAH THIS IS MORE THAN ENOUGH
THERE WE GO I'VE GOT A BIT MORE OF THE CABLE
OKAY
OH
THERE WE GO
IS THAT OKAY
YEAH I THINK YOU CAN PULL IT OUT NOW
THANK YOU JUST PULL IT CLOSER A LITTLE BIT
UH YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO AND YEAH THERE YOU GO
YEAH YOU MIGHT
GET IT RIGHT OVER OKAY THANK YOU
AH
LOOK AT THAT
JUST THEIR GENERAL USE OF THE REMOTE CONTROL YOU CAN SEE WE HAD A HUNDRED SUBJECTS THERE
UM SO THAT'S WHERE WE STARTED WE USED OUR OUR USABILITY LAB
THE COMPANY'S USABILITY LAB WE DID OUR USUAL SELECTION METHODS TO GET A CROSS SECTION OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC
MALE AND FEMALE ALL AGE GROUPS FROM FIFTEEN UPWARDS AND UM WE OBSERVED THEM IN THE LAB
OKAY UM I'M GOING TO LOOK AT THE FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS FROM THE MARKETING POINT OF VIEW AND UH OBVIOUSLY OUR STARTING POINT WITH MARKETING IS ALWAYS MARKET RESEARCH
THE OVERALL THING WHICH I'VE I'VE GOT AT THE TOP THERE IN ITALICS IS THAT USERS DISLIKE THE LOOK AND FEEL OF CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS
OUR FINDINGS LOTS OF FINDINGS I'VE JUST SUMMARISED SOME OF THEM HERE
SO IT HAS OBVIOUS DESIGN IMPLICATIONS THERE
UM WE FOUND THAT SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF USERS FIND MOST REMOTE CONTROLS UGLY
EIGHTY PERCENT WOULD SPEND MORE MONEY WHEN A REMOTE CONTROL WOULD LOOK FANCY WE WERE QUITE SURPRISED BY THAT FINDING
UM CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS DO NOT MATCH WELL WITH THE OPERATING BEHAVIOUR OF THE USER OVERALL
SO AGAIN THERE'S POWER IMPLICATIONS THERE
BUT UM THAT'S QUITE A HIGH PROPORTION OF OUR OUR YOU KNOW INTERNATIONAL TARGET GROUP ARE PREPARED TO SPEND MORE MONEY FOR SOMETHING THAT'S A BIT NICER LOOKING
FOR EXAMPLE YOU CAN SEE BELOW THERE SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF USERS ZAP A LOT SO YOU'VE GOT YOUR PERSON SUNK BACK IN THE SOFA CHANNEL HOPPING
YEAH
UM FIFTY PERCENT OF USERS ONLY USE TEN PERCENT OF THE BUTTONS SO AGAIN A BIG DESIGN ISSUE THERE
UM AND POSSIBLY WE CAN ALSO CUT BACK ON COST IF WE DON'T HAVE SO MANY FUNCTIONS ACTUALLY ON THE REMOTE CONTROL
UM
IT'S A SLIPPING DOWN THE BACK OF THE SOFA TYPE OF THING UH FIFTY PERCENT WERE WERE PARTICULARLY FRUSTRATED BY THAT
UH THIRTY FOUR PERCENT OF PEOPLE TAKE SAID THEY TAKE TOO MUCH TIME TO LEARN TO USE AND I THINK THAT TIES IN WITH THE UM THE PREVIOUS FINDING OF PEOPLE ONLY USING TEN PERCENT OF THE BUTTONS
THEY JUST CAN'T BE BOTHERED TO LEARN ABOUT THE OTHER FUNCTIONS
THE BIGGEST FRUSTRATIONS THAT PEOPLE FOUND WITH REGARD TO PERSONAL PREFERENCES WERE UM SOMETHING THAT YOU YOU MENTIONED EARLIER UH REMOTE CONTROLS ARE OFTEN LOST IN THE ROOM
SOMETHING WE DIDN'T PUT TO THEM
AGAIN THAT WAS TO AID I THINK IN UH WHEN THEY'VE LOST THE ACTUAL REMOTE CONTROL SOME KIND OF SPEECH RECOGNITION
POSSIBLY
UM UM SLIGHTLY MORE THAN A QUARTER OF PEOPLE SAID IT WAS BAD FOR UH REPETITIVE STRAIN INJURY
YOU KNOW THOSE SMALL MOVEMENTS OF THE REMOTE CONTROL CAN LEAD TO KIND OF SHOULDER AND ELBOW PROBLEMS
SO THIRTY FIVES AND UNDERS WHO WOULD LIKE THOSE TWO FEATURES
UM THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE THIRTY FIVE AND UNDER AGE GROUP WOULD LIKE UM A LIQUID CRYSTAL DISPLAY AND SPEECH RECOGNITION
UM THAT TREND REVERSES IN THE OLDER AGE GROUPS
THAT KIND OF EVENS OUT THIRTY FIVE TO FORTY FIVE AND IN THE OLDER AGE GROUP IT KIND OF REVERSES THEY'RE NOT SO BOTHERED WITH THIS
BUT WHICH I'M THINKING OF NOW IS UM EVEN IF PERHAPS THE LOST CONTROL CAN GIVE OFF A BLEEP EVERY NOW AND AGAIN TIL YOU FIND IT OR A FLASHING LIGHT
IF THERE'S ANY MORE INFORMATION I CAN EMAIL YOU EXTRA DETAILS IS THAT OKAY
I HAD MARVELLOUS TABLES AND THINGS THAT I COULD SHOW YOU BUT I THINK I'LL JUST KEEP IT SIMPLE
'KAY
YEAH
OKAY
THAT'S FINE
OKAY
RIGHT UM
HUH
WE HAVE NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENTS UM
UM
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE USING TELETEXT UM APPARENTLY THE CONSUMERS CONSIDER IT OUTDATED WITH THE INTERNET NOW
OKAY
OUR CONTROL IS ONLY GOING TO BE FOR T. V. IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A COMBINED CONTROL
WHICH LIMITS YOU KNOW ALL OF THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT IT LIMITS THE COST FOR US BUT IT ALSO MAKES IT EASIER TO UNDERSTAND FOR THE CONSUMER
MM-HMM
MM-HMM SO CAN WE NOT PROGRAMME A VIDEO WITH THIS REMOTE CONTROL
IT SAYS FOR T. V. ONLY SO LOOKS LIKE IT'S JUST YEAH I THINK MAYBE SKY THINGS LIKE THAT MIGHT BE INCORPORATED INTO IT BUT
JUST CHANNEL HOPPING
IT JUST SAID FOR T. V. ONLY
I DON'T KNOW WHAT DO YOU THINK
BUT I MEAN GENERAL T. V. CONTROLS DO DO VIDEO AS WELL
WOULD THAT IMPLY VIDEO USE
T YEAH YEAH
I D WELL I DUNNO 'CAUSE UH THE W IF YOU'VE G
I MEAN YOU BU WELL SOM YOU GET COM YOU GET COMBINED T. V. AND VIDEOS DON'T YOU
IF YEAH AND IF YOU GOT IF YOU GOT A SKY BOX THEY HAVE ONE OF THOSE PLUS BOXES
YOU CAN RECORD STRAIGHT OFF THE T. V. ANYWAY SO ON TO ON TO LIKE THE T. V. HARD DRIVE OR SO
YEAH
MM-HMM YES
MM
I THINK WE ASSUME THAT IT'S STILL GOT PLAY AND STOP FUNCTIONS AND PROGRAMMING
YES
ANYTHING ABOUT THAT ON THE MARKET RESEARCH OR SOMETHING LIKE REGARDING WHETHER PEOPLE WANT A COMBINED SOMETHING LIKE THAT
YEAH
SO I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO LOOK AT
I THINK TH TH THOSE DO TEND TO BE THE BASIC CHANNEL HOPPING THINGS AND ON AND OFF FOR THE VIDEO FAST FORWARDING
UM WE DIDN'T REALLY LOOK INTO THAT BUT REMEMBER WE FOUND THAT FINDING THAT MOST PEOPLE ONLY USE ABOUT UH TEN PERCENT OF THE BUTTONS
SO ON AND I THINK IT'S SORT OF GENERAL KNOWLEDGE THAT PEOPLE DO FIND PROGRAMMING THEIR VIDEOS A NIGHTMARE
MM
TEN PERC
MM-HMM
YEAH
OKAY
HMM
JU UM JUST AS AN IDEA ON THE UH SPEECH RECOGNITION THING THAT PR IT'D PROBABLY BE QUITE EXPENSIVE TO INCORPORATE AN ENTIRE SPEECH RECOGNITION THING AND THEY'RE NOT THAT GREAT ANYWAY
MM-HMM
PENS
WOULD YOU PREFER AN L. C. D. SCREEN THAT'S MULTI FUNCTION REMOTE AND WOULD YOU PAY MORE FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION IN A REMOTE CONTROL
SO YOU CAN SEE HOW THE THE YES NO SORT OF VARIES ACROSS THE AGE GROUP THERE
AND A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF DON'T KNOWS IN THE OLDER AGE GROUP I THINK THAT'S JUST GENERAL FEAR OF NEW TECHNOLOGY
IN FACT I'VE JUST CALLED UP THAT TABLE THERE WE ASKED THOSE TWO QUESTIONS THE TABLE RELATES TO BOTH QUESTIONS SO WE DIDN'T DIFFERENTIATE
ALRIGHT OKAY
ALRIGHT OKAY
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH BU
YEAH BUT UM ON ON THAT AGAIN I JUST THOUGHT 'CAUSE YOU CAN GET THOSE KEY CHAINS NOW AND YOU WHISTLE AND THEN IT'LL LET OFF A LOUD NOISE TO LET YOU KNOW WHERE IT IS SO I THOUGHT THAT COULD BE QUITE A
MM-HMM
OH YEAH
RIGHT
WE DO HAVE A BUDGET LIMITATION THAT WE CAN'T CONTROL OURSELVES
SO I THINK WHEN WE CAN TAKE A CHEAPER OPTION WHICH STILL DOES THE SAME KINDA THING UM BECAUSE IT IS SOMETHING I IT NEEDS TO BE THE THING THAT YOU
MM
MAYBE ON THE T. V. YOU COULD PUT LIKE A PACK ON THE T. V. OR SOMETHING SO YOU CAN'T SEE THE REMOTE
USE TO FIND IT NEEDS TO BE SOMETHING THAT YOU DON'T LOSE YOU WERE SAYING WHISTLING
YOU GO AND PRESS THE BUTTON ON TOP OF THE T. V. AND IT BEEPS AND YOU'RE LIKE OH OKAY IT'S OVER THERE
SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT THAT'S THAT SOUNDS A LOT CHEAPER TO ME
YEAH
YEAH
YES
YEAH
OKAY
THAT'S A SUPER IDEA
YEAH
HMM
YEAH
UM SO WE WANT LOGO WE WANT UM
UM THE THIRD THING WAS THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THE CORPORATE IMAGE IS VERY MUCH INCORPORATED INTO THE HANDSET
FASHIONABLE TRENDY I MEAN WHAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT WITH THE MARKETING
UM PEOPLE PAYING MORE FOR IT TO LOOK GOOD
UM WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THAT AS WELL
YES FURTHER MARKET RESEARCH WILL BE NEEDED TO KIND OF FOCUS ON WHAT THAT IS
IT'S IT'S GONNA VARY AROUND THE WORLD
IT'S THE USER INTERFACE DESIGN THAT MAY AND TH THE SORT OF YOU KNOW FASHIONABLE ASPECT OF IT WE MIGHT HAVE TO CHANGE FOR DIFFERENT MARKETS ROUND THE WORLD
WHAT IS UM ATTRACTIVE TO A TRENDY NEW YORKER AND WHAT IS ATTRACTIVE TO A RETIRED SOUTH AFRICAN I DUNNO YOU GET THE IDEA
IT'S GONNA BE DIFFERENT FOR A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD TH FOR SOMEBODY WHO'S SIXTY AND ALSO ACROSS THE WORLD IF WE'RE AIMING AT THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET
AT THE END OF THE DAY TH THE ENGINEERING DESIGN IS ONE THING
YEAH
MM
YEAH
YEAH
SO ARE WE TALKING OF A SINGLE MODEL OR MAYBE FIVE SIX DESIGNS
SURE
WELL Y YEAH YOU COULD YOU COULD HAVE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT DESIGNS I MEAN INSIDE THEY'D BE ESSENTIALLY EXACTLY THE SAME
ALRIGHT
RIGHT
MM-HMM
JUST YEAH YEAH
THE FEATURES COULD BE SAME AND THE BODY COULD LOOK SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT
YEAH
MM
SO
WHAT ABOUT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE BUTTONS UM THE CONTROLS THAT ARE COMING OUT NOW HAVE KIND OF BIG
RUBBER BUTTONS NOT TINY LITTLE ONE BIG RUBBER BUTTONS BUT WHAT ABOUT I MEAN 'CAUSE WE GOT TO MAKE IT ORIGINAL
YEAH
'KAY
WHAT ABOUT
UM YOU KNOW WITH THE TOUCH SCREEN COMPUTERS
YEAH YEAH THAT'S WHAT I WAS JUST YEAH
YEAH
UM SO YOU IT'S LIKE A LITTLE PANEL THAT YOU TOUCH RATHER THAN A BUTTON WHICH SHOULDN'T WEAR OUT AS MUCH EITHER NOT SURE ABOUT THE
NO WELL NO 'CAUSE YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO YOU DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO PRESS THEM YOU JUST
UM THINK THAT MIGHT APPEAL I'M THINKING KIND OF JAPAN I'M THINKING UH YOUNG UM OFFICE PEOPLE TRENDY KIND OF A THING
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PRESS IT YOU JUST HAVE TO PUT YOUR THUMB ONTO IT
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM
YEAH
YES IT WILL APPEAL TO SECTIONS OF THE MARKET DEF
UM BUT QUITE UM
EASILY LABELLED SO THAT ANYONE CAN OH YEAH THAT'S OBVIOUS WHAT THAT'S FOR AND IT'S NOT DAUNTING TO MAYBE THE OLDER GENERATIONS UM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM MM
ERGONOMICS UH THERE'S SORT OF PHYSICALLY DIFFERENT THINGS 'CAUSE UM IF YOU'VE EVER SEEN THE X. BOX THEY HAD TO MAKE TWO DIFFERENT SIZED CONTROLLERS BECAUSE PEOPLE IN JAPAN WOULDN'T BUY IT BECAUSE THE CONTROLLER WAS PHYSICALLY TO BIG BECAUSE UM
BUT ALSO ER ERGONOMICS AS WE'RE SAYING WITH THE DIFFERENT DESIGNS
MM
WERE TOO BIG
THEY'RE C UH JUST GENERALLY JAPANESE PEOPLE HAVE SMALLER HANDS SO THEY COULDN'T GET ROUND THE CONTROLLER WHICH IS UH SO IF YOU I DON'T KNOW WHAT 'CAUSE YOU OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN HAVE BIGGER BUTTONS FOR SOME COUNTRIES OR SOMETHING AND SMALLER ONES FOR OTHERS
MM
THE INJURIES MAYBE A TOUCH SCREEN COULD BE A BETTER OPTION FOR THAT
YEAH UH MAYBE TO AS UH IT IT WAS INDICATED THAT UH UH RISK UH OF UH REPEATED USE
YEAH
YEAH
YOU'RE DESI UH DIVIDING IT ACCORDING TO THE COUNTRIES ALSO THE MARKET
SO A BIGGER B OKAY SO Y YOU'RE DIVIDING DESIGNS BASED ON NOT ONLY SEGMENT AGE GROUPS
MAYBE FOR U. S. AND ALL YOU CAN HAVE A SLIGHTLY BIGGER REMOTE CONTROL AND MAYBE IN JAPAN AND ALL YOU NEED TO HAVE A SMALL YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
HMM
I THINK WE HAVE TO DESIGN ONE PRODUCT AND THEN THE COMPANY CAN TAKE IT WHEREVER THEY WANT TO UH IN THE SENSE THAT THEY CAN MAKE IT SMALLER
OR THEY CAN MAKE IT BIGGER OR THEY CAN CHANGE THE FEATURES SLIGHTLY UM
HUH
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
TH THE INTERNAL D ENGINEERING DESIGN HAS GOT TO REMAIN THE SAME YES ABSOLUTELY
IT'S GONNA BE THE SAME SO WE NEED TO FOCUS ON JUST ONE THING NOT GET BOGGED DOWN IN LOTS OF DIFFERENT UM POSSIBILITIES UM
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
I'M CONCERNED WHEN YOU READ THE THE R. S. I. ISSUE AGAIN REPETITIVE STRAIN INJURY
I DON'T THINK JUST MOVING YOUR FINGER AROUND ON A SMALL SCREEN IS GOING TO DEAL WITH THAT ENOUGH
UM R. S. I. TENDS TO BE CAUSED BY REPETITIVE SMALL MOVEMENTS
I THINK THAT IS STILL A KIND OF A QUESTION MARK ISSUE HOW WE DEAL WITH THAT
YEAH
I'M J I REALLY CAN'T GET MY HEAD ROUND THIS ONE THIS MAY HAVE TO BE POSTPONED TO A FUTURE MEETING BUT IT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT
YEAH
I YEAH I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT HOW YOU COULD COMBAT THAT 'CAUSE WITHOUT WITHOUT DOING SOMETHING WHERE YOU HAVE TO MOVE YOUR ARM AROUND TO CHANGE THE CHANNEL AND IT BECOMES YEAH
MM
I KNOW AND IT BECOMES RIDICULOUS YES I KNOW
OR A SPEECH RECOGNITION WHICH IS EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE I THINK THAT'S THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU KIND OF AVOID
YEAH SPEECH RECOGNITION BUT YEAH
YEAH
YES
MM-HMM
THAT KIND OF ISSUE
DO WE HAVE TO INITIALLY UM YOU KNOW LOOKING AT THE FINDINGS HERE FOCUS ON
A YOUNGER AGE GROUP INITIALLY AND THEN BROADEN OUT THE MARKET LATER
DO WE REALLY HAVE TO GO FOR EVERYONE RIGHT AWAY
UM
MM
WE COULD FOCUS ON THE BIGGEST MARKET
MM
GE UH
IF SAY PEOPLE BETWEEN AGE GROUP OF TWENTY TO THIRTY FIVE ARE THE BIGGEST MARKET
AND WHEN WE'VE BEEN THROWING UP OUR IDEAS WE'RE AUTOMATICALLY TALKING ABOUT BUSINESS PEOPLE YOUNG PEOPLE TRENDY PEOPLE
WE ARE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT UM
THE TYPE OF COMPANY THAT WE'RE WORKING FOR AS WELL
BUT I DON'T THINK WE'RE FOCUSING ON THAT I THINK WE ARE FOCUSING ON A SORT OF MID RANGE UM
NOW WITH THE BABY BOOMERS THE OLDER GENERATIONS ARE ACTUALLY LARGER THEY HAVE A GREATER POPULATION THAN US YOUNG PEOPLE
THAT THEY WANT UM IT TO BE FASHIONABLE THEY WANT IT TO BE TRENDY AND YOU WOULDN'T AUTOMATICALLY ASSUME ASSOCIATE THAT WITH THE OLDER GENERATIONS
MM
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM
BUSINESS KIND OF CLASS TYPE PEOPLE
WE WANT TO YOU KNOW NOT WASTE MONEY NOT BE PROFLIGATE AND UH
I'M JUST THINKING OF BUDGETARY ISSUES TOO FOR WHEN IT DOES GET TO THE SORT OF BROAD SCALE MARKETING STAGE
MM
MM-HMM
FIRST IT'S MOST LIKELY TO BE TAKEN UP FIRST OF ALL WHERE THE MAIN PURCHASING POWER IS COMING FROM FOR A PRODUCT LIKE THIS
YOU KNOW FOCUS ON WHERE THE IDEA WILL BE TAKEN UP
UM WE'VE GOT THE T. V. WE'VE GOT THE VIDEO NOW THERE'S UM
OKAY SO THE REMOTE CONTROL FUNCTIONS
MM-HMM
I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT IT'S CALLED THE LITTLE CODE AT THE END OF PROGRAMME DETAILS YES
VIDEO PLUS
WE COULD USE THAT AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO PROGRAMMING IN TIMES THINGS LIKE THAT IS THAT I ALWAYS FOUND THAT REALLY EASY WHEN I DISCOVERED IT UM
YEAH YEAH
MM
MM-HMM
THAT'S FINE BUT IF YOU DO WANT TO TAPE SOMETHING IN TWO DAYS TIME AND YOU'RE NOT SURE IF YOU'RE GOING TO
YOU PUT THE NUMBER IN AND IT'S JUST A NUMBER IT'S NOT A DATE IT'S NOT A TIME
IT'S NOT A CHANNEL IT'S NOT WHEN IT FINISHES IT'S NOT ANYTHING LIKE THAT IT'S JUST A NUMBER
BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT YOUR GENERAL RECORD ANYWAY SO IF YOU THERE'S A PROGRAMME ON YOU WANT TO PUT RECORD ON
JUST WHACK IN THE NUMBER
YOU JUST NEED ONE 'CAUSE YOU'VE ALREADY GOT ALL THE NUMBERS THERE ANYWAY YEAH
AND YOU WOULDN'T YOU WOULDN'T NEED UH A WHOLE HOST OF EXTRA BUTTONS FOR THAT
AND YOU W YEAH
NO
YOU'VE ALREADY GOT THE NUMBERS FOR TYPING IN ANYWAY
RIGHT I'VE NOT COME ACROSS THAT FUNCTION BUT IT SOUNDS WONDERFUL
IT IS AFTER UM IF YOU LOOK IN THE NEWSPAPER T. V. GUIDE OR ANY T. V. GUIDE THERE'S A FIVE
UM AND IT HAS BEEN AROUND FOR QUITE A LONG TIME
SIX DIGIT NUMBER AFTERWARDS AND THAT'S THE NUMBER YOU PUT IN AND IT'S RECORDED THAT IT'S GOING TO BE ON ON TUESDAYS AT TEN O'CLOCK ON THE SEVENTEENTH SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT DATES AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT TIMES
IT'S NOT
YEAH
AH HMM
RIGHT
IT'S BEEN BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG TIME IT'S JUST IT'S NOT VERY WELL ADVERTISED AS TO HOW TO USE IT AND THINGS
NO IT'S NOT UM BUT I THINK IF AWARENESS WAS KIND OF BROUGHT TO THE FOREFRONT ABOUT THAT
SUPERB
MM
THOUGH IF Y IF YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING LIKE SKY ANYWAY YOU CAN JUST CLICK ON IT YOU CAN JUST PRESS THE BUTTON ON THE PROGRAMME ONCE AND IT'LL RECORD THAT PROGRAMME WHEN IT'S ON AND YOU PRESS IT ON IT TWICE AND IT'LL RECORD THE WHOLE SERIES
MM
YES
MM
RIGHT
EXCELLENT MM-HMM
BUT JUST TO HAVE THAT FUNCTION WOULD BE WOULD BE REALLY GOOD
SO THAT YEAH
MM
RIGHT
OKAY SO
IF THEY KNOW THEY CAN JUST POP INTO ONE OF OUR HIGH STREET OUTLETS TH YOU KNOW WHICH BUTTON IS IT I PRESS FOR THIS
THAT THAT'S KIND OF WHAT LED US ON TO COMPARING T. V. REMOTE CONTROLS WITH WITH THEIR DESIGN FEATURES UM CHAIN COMPANIES LIKE CARPHONE WAREHOUSE
IS IT WORTHWHILE WITH WITH OUR RETAIL OUTLETS HAVING A A SIMILAR UM KIND OF SERVICE SO THAT IF OLDER USERS WERE DETERRED FROM BUYING THIS
BUT JUST DISCUSSING THE DIFFERENT AGE GROUPS AND TARGETING THE DIFFERENT AGE GROUPS IT OCCURS TO ME TO PRODUCE OUR OWN MOBILE PHONES
THEY'LL PHONE THE COMPANY YOU CAN USE THEIR TELEPHONES
YOU CAN POP IN ANYTIME WITH A PHONE THAT YOU BOUGHT FOR THEM W IF YOU'VE GOT ANY PROBLEMS WITH IT AND THEY'LL FIX IT
TH AS FREE AS A FREE ASPECT OF OUR SERVICE WOULD THAT NOT MAKE IT MORE ATTRACTIVE TO THEM
CAN I JUST RUN THIS PAST YOU WHILE IT OCCURS TO ME I DON'T MEAN TO QUICKLY JUMP FROM ONE SUBJECT TO ANOTHER
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM
BUT THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT WITH A MOBILE PHONE YOU SIGNED FOR A CONTRACT SO THEY UM THE COMPANIES WHO UH WHO YOU DEAL WITH HAVE ACTUALLY THEY'VE THEY'VE GOT AN OBLIGATION TO TO HELP YOU OUT AND ALSO I MEAN IT'S IT'S FAIR ENOUGH TO HAVE SOME SORT OF HELP SERVICE BUT I I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH THE COST WOULD BE OF HAVING
MM-HMM
MM
RIGHT
THE FUNCTIONALITY OF IT IN THE SENSE THAT YOU'RE SITTING THERE YOU'RE PRESSING THIS BUTTON AND YOUR T. V. 'S NOT DOING IT
ALRIGHT
TAKING YOUR T. V. AND YOUR CONTROL AND SAYING LOOK THIS IS WHAT I'M DOING IT'S NOT WORKING WHAT SHOULD I DO
YES
BUT I MEAN FOR IF THERE WERE ANY MORE OR ARE WE ABSOLUTELY DEFINITE IT'S ONLY GONNA BE FOR T. V. AND VIDEO
WE'RE NOT GONNA PUT ANY OKAY JUST A THOUGHT
IF IT WAS SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS YOU COULDN'T CHANGE THE CHANNEL
YEAH I MEAN
UM
I THINK SO
I MEAN INSTRU INSTRUCTION BOOKS I FEEL C I RECKON CAN COVER THAT
INSTRUCTION MANUALS
BUT I MEAN THEY'RE THERE'S CUSTOMER SERVICE
THERE'S NO EXTRA T THE PERSON HAS TO WALK TO A SHOP ON THE HIGH STREET UM
THERE WILL BE A CUSTOMER SERVICE NUMBER THING THAT YOU CAN PHONE UP AND SPEAK TO AND THAT WAY THERE'S NO CALL OUT CHARGE
OKAY
YEAH
DEPARTMENT YEAH
MM-HMM
SURE
MM
I THINK IT WILL BE TOO MUCH OF AN EFFORT FOR A PERSON TO FOR A PHONE MAYBE HE MIGHT WALK DOWN THE STREET
RIGHT
BUT FOR A REMOTE HE WILL JUST REFER TO THE MANUAL AND ALL THAT
YEAH
YEAH
NOT FOR SUCH SIMPLE FUNCTIONS BECAUSE WE'RE FOCUSING ON THAT YES OKAY
AND THEY'RE YEAH THEY SHOULD BE F YEAH
SO THAT SHOULD BE SOMETHING WE THINK ABOUT
IT DOES YOU JUST PUT IT IN THE DRAWER UNTIL SOMETHING GOES WRONG AND THEN YOU TRY AND SEARCH THROUGH IT
BUT WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT C 'CAUSE YOU'VE GOT THE DILEMMA BETWEEN OH BATTERIES THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING ABOUT
WE NEED I'M NOT SURE IF WE NEED A DESIGN UM DECISION NOW
MOBILE PHONE BATTERIES WHAT KINDA BATTERY IS THAT
UM WHAT OTHER FUNCTIONS
MM
BUT WE SHOULD FOCUS ON MAKING THE MANUAL AS USER FRIENDLY AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE A LOT OF THEM ARE JUST TINY LITTLE WRITING AND LOTS AND LOTS OF PAGES
SIMPLE
MM
YEAH
YEAH
PUTS PEOPLE OFF READING THEM SO THEY JUST DO THE OBVIOUS YES
IT'S THE UH YEAH
SURE OKAY
MM-HMM
UM THEY'RE THEY'RE SPECIALLY MADE FOR THE FOR THE MOBILE PHONES
BUT THEY COME WITH A CHARGER I MEAN YOU COULD YOU COULD BUNDLE A CHARGER IN WITH IT BUT
YOU SIT IT IN ITS CHARGER WHEN YOU'RE NOT USING IT OR T AT NIGHT OR SOMETHING
BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER 'CAUSE IT NEVER REALLY RUNS OUT 'CAUSE IT LASTS A LONG TIME ONCE IT IS CHARGED
UM SOMETHING LIKE THAT SHOULD REDUCE THE SIZE OF IT
WELL THEY LA THEY THEY LAST QUITE A LONG TIME AND IF YOU HAD UH WHEN YOU TH THE THING THAT YOU GET WITH MOBILE HOUSE PHONES
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH AND IF YEAH IF YOU IF YOU HAD IF YOU HAD ONE OF THOSE UH JUST COMING BACK TO YOUR OTHER POINT ABOUT PRESSING THE BUTTON AND SETTING OFF THE BLEEPER IN THE ROOM THAT COULD UH
YEAH IT COULD BE ON THAT YEAH OKAY
YEAH ON THAT AS WELL SO
S
SO ARE WE TALKING OF A CONCEPT OF A RECHARGEABLE SOMETHING ON THE REMOTE
YEAH SOME SORT OF DOCKING STATION OR YEAH
YES
RECHARGEABLE WITH A DOCKING STATION
MM-HMM
SO THE RECHARGEABLE WHICH WOULD BE YOUR
YEAH YEAH TH YEAH THAT THAT'D BE FINE AND ALSO THAT WOULD MEAN THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TO GO OUT BUYING BATTERIES ALL THE TIME
FIELD
OKAY
YES WHICH IT IS CHEAPER IN THE LONG RUN AS WELL
BECAUSE THEN YOU HAVE GOT THE REPETITIVE STRAIN INJURY NO MATTER HOW MANY HOW MUCH YOU TRY AND MAKE IT SIMPLE UM
UM TH THE SHAPE YOU GOT TRENDY
I DON'T WANNA BIG BOX WITH LOTS OF THINGS YOU DON'T WANT A TINY SORT OF LITTLE THING EITHER
MM-HMM
RIGHT
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM
AND WE DON'T W I MEAN SO MANY REMOTE CONTROLS LOOK ABSOLUTELY IDENTICAL THESE LONG
WE DEFINITELY AN OB AN OBVIOUS THING A VERY SIMPLE THING IS TO GET AWAY FROM THESE BROWN RECTANGLES WE DON'T WANT THAT
BROWN THINGS WITH THE SAME COLOURED BUTTONS ALL CRAMMED IN ON THE S THE SURFACE
THEY DO
YEAH
OKAY SO WE'VE GOT A FLIP SCREEN
OKAY
UM
WHAT I WAS THINKING OF A DESIGN WHICH NOKIA H UH CAME UP WITH ALMOST SIX OR SEVEN YEARS BACK
BASICALLY WE HAVE A FLAT ONE IT IT LOOKS LIKE A BOX LIKE A CHOCOLATE
SO IT'S LIKE UH YOU CAN SAY A BANANA SHAPE KIND OF THING CURLED UP LIKE A BOAT
THAT'S VERY STRENUOUS BECAUSE YOUR THUMB IS SLIGHTLY UP SO THEY CAME UP WITH SOMETHING LIKE THIS CURLED UP SO HERE
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO YOU DON'T BEND YOUR THUMB TOO MUCH
YEAH
MM-HMM
SLIGHTLY CURVED CURVED
YEAH
OKAY
G UH SO WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU DON'T HAVE TO PRESS YOUR THUMB TOO DOWN LIKE
SO IT'S ALREADY CURLED UP SO YOUR THUMB DOESN'T Y YEAH SO WE CAN HAVE A S LIKE YOU KNOW MOULDED ACCORDING TO YOUR
MM
'CAUSE IT'S KIND OF MOULDED TO YOUR HAND ANYWAY
MM
YEAH
THE WAY YOU H HOLD OF IT'S KIND OF SEMI CIRCULAR IN THE BOTTOM SOMETHING LIKE THAT
OKAY
I WOULDN'T SAY EXACTLY SEMI CIRCULAR BUT YEAH SMOOTH
CAN YOU LOOK INTO THE COMPANY LOGO
UM THINGS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY IN VIEW TO TRYING TO INCORPORATE THAT INTO THE DESIGN OF THE PRODUCT
I MEAN
CURRENT
OR SOMETHING UM SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES TO BE ABLE TO INCORPORATE IT QUITE
FOR EXAMPLE IF IT WAS A C. OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU COULD HAVE IT IN A VAGUE C. SHAPE THAT OPENS UP KIND OF LIKE A SHELL
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
UM OBVIOUSLY INTO THE DESIGN WHILE ALSO MAKING IT QUITE DIFFERENT FROM ANYTHING ELSE THAT'S THERE
WE COULD LOOK IN AT THAT BUT
I MEAN LOOK AT THE MOBILE
MM
MM
WHAT WE WERE TALKING IS TO MAKE IT MORE
RATHER THAN LIKE SEA SHELLS LOGO COULD BECOME AS YOU COULD PUT A LOGO IN THE CORNER OF UH THE MODEL
RATHER THAN YOU KNOW TRYING TO MAKE IT LIKE A SEA SHELL OR WHATEVER YOU WERE TA TELLING LIKE
WELL WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW IT'S GONNA LOOK DIFFERENT
I'VE NOT COME ACROSS ANYTHING LIKE THAT BEFORE IF IT KIND OF YEAH AND THAT OPENS OUT INTO YOUR FLIP TOP
I THINK IT'S A REALLY NICE IDEA AND PLUS YOU CAN GET YOU KNOW EVEN THOUGH WE'RE USING PLASTIC
YOU CAN STILL I MEAN THINK OF THE DESIGNS YOU CAN GET IN PLASTIC WE CAN DO A NICE CONCH SHELL OR SCALLOP SHELL EXTERIOR
NICE TO HOLD IN THE PALM OF THE HAND AND JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE HAVING TO ACTUALLY INSERT IN BETWEEN THE TWO COVERS
THEN IT'S NICE T TO H YOU CAN MAKE IT LIGHTWEIGHT PLASTIC
I THINK THAT'S THAT SOUNDS A REALLY ATTRACTIVE IDEA
THAT'S GONNA TAKE CARE OF SOME OF THE REPETITIVE STRAIN INJURY TRYING P PREVENT A LOT OF THAT I WOULD THINK
A SEA SHELL
YEAH
YEAH WE COULD LOOK IN AT THAT
YOU COULD HAVE DIFFERENT KIND OF CASINGS
OR YOU COULD DO UM DIFFERENT LIKE YOU GET WITH MOBILE PHONES DIFFERENT FASCIAS
SO YOU COULD HAVE LIKE PSYCHEDELIC ONES FOR YOUNGER PEOPLE AND SLEEK ONES AND
MM
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
LESS CHANCE OF IT BEING LOST TOO
IT'S EASIER TO BIT NICE TO HANDLE
IT'S NOT LIKE A CHOCOLATE BROWN LOZENGE THAT'S GONNA GO DOWN THE SOFA AND PEOPLE MIGHT WANT TO PUT IT ON THEIR MANTELPIECE OR WHATEVER AS A KI IF IT LOOKS ATTRACTIVE ENOUGH AS A KIND OF ORNAMENT THEY DON'T NOT GONNA LOSE IT SO MUCH EITHER
YEAH
MM
SIX DES DESIGNS AND THEN CHOOSE WHICH ARE WHICHEVER APPEALS THE MOST LIKE THAT COULD BE THE MOST COMMON DESIGN
YEAH MAYBE WE COULD COME AT SOME SAY FIVE
OKAY
YEAH
MM-HMM
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
BUT WE CAN LIKE THINK OF FIVE SIX DESIGNS
RIGHT I THINK WE HAVE TO ROUND IT UP UM
CAN I JUST QUICKLY UM GO OVER THE NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENTS SO THAT I HAVEN'T MISSED ANYTHING
SO IT'S NO TELETEXT IT'S ONLY FOR T. V. AND BY IMPLICATION VIDEO OUR CORPORATE IMAGE SHOULD BE INCORPORATED IN THE REMOTE CONTROL UM SOMETHING ABOUT VIDEOPLUS
SURE
MM-HMM
THAT WAS UM IN CUTTING DOWN THE NUMBER THAT WAS KINDA SEPARATE THAT WAS CUTTING DOWN THE NUMBER OF FUNCTIONS
MAKING IT SIMPLER SO INSTEAD OF HAVING LOTS OF THINGS YOU PUT IN FOR DATE
RIGHT
RIGHT
RIGHT SO WHEN THEY PRESS FOR PROGRAMMING YOU IT COMES UP ON THE L. C. D. A REMINDER ABOUT USING VIDEOPLUS
SO THAT THEY HAVE A LOOK AT THE GUIDE AND
OR WAS IS THIS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE PROJECT REQUIREMENTS IS THIS JUST THAT WAS AN ADD ON FEATURE
IT'S KINDA TAKES THE PLACE OF HAVING A BUTTON TO PRESS FOR THE DATE AND HAVING THE BUTTON TO PRESS FOR THE CHANNEL THINGS LIKE THAT
UM IT COULD BE IT C
UH-HUH
RIGHT
RIGHT
RIGHT SO IT'S KIND OF DOING AWAY WITH THE PROGRAMMING FEATURE
IT YES IT COULD BE UH ADV ADVERTISEMENT FEATURE UM RATHER THAN DESIGN FEATURE YOU KNOW DRAWING ATTENTION TO THAT
YEAH
AND IT ALSO PAID UM LIP SERVICE IN THE INSTRUCTION MANUAL 'CAUSE IT'S VERY SIMPLE SO PUTTING IT DOWN IN WORDS SHOULD BE HELPFUL
MM AND THE RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES
WAS THERE ANYTHING ELSE THERE THAT WE IN THE NEW NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENTS
YEAH
UM
YEAH
WE'VE GOT THE BUTTONS BUT I THINK WE'LL WORK THROUGH THAT WITH THE DESIGN OF IT UM
YEAH
MM-HMM
WHAT PREFERENCE SO IT MAY COME ROUND TO MARKET RESEARCH AT SOME POINT TO SEE WHAT PEOPLE WOULD LIKE
THAT'S NOT AT THE MOMENT A REQUIREMENT IT'S SOMETHING WE'RE LOOKING AT
YES
YES
AND WE'VE TALKED ABOUT UM THERE BEING AN ALARM OR SOMETHING A BEEPING FOR BEING LOST UM
FOR DETECTION RIGHT
YEAH
BUT THERE AREN'T GONNA BE THAT FUNC THAT MANY FUNCTIONS INCORPORATED INTO IT SO IT SHOULD BE FINE AND THE I THE INSTRUCTION MANUAL
I DON'T KNOW IF WE DEAL WITH THAT UM
LEARNING HOW TO USE IT SHOULD BE AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE
I THINK
YEP I THINK THAT'S US
YEP AND DIFFERENT FROM WHAT'S OUT THERE
YEP I THINK
OKAY
OR SHALL I JUST SORT OF GENERALLY LOOK AT ALL THE ISSUES INVOLVED
WHAT WOULD YOU SPECIFICALLY LIKE MARKETING TO LOOK AT BEFORE THE NEXT MEETING
TRUE
OKAY
I THINK YOU MIGHT GET GUIDANCE BUT UM
I TH
INSTRUCTION MANUALS 'CAUSE THERE TENDS TO BE A
OKAY
DEMONISED THING U UM THEY'RE EVERYONE'S GOT LIKE A BIG PILE OF THEM BUT NO ONE REALLY USES THEM
OKAY
UM
WHOOPS QUESTIONNAIRE FOUR
WE SHOULD F
OOPS
YES RIGHT
OKAY
'CAUSE WE'RE AT LUNCHTIME NOW I THINK
I THINK IT'S TIME FOR US TO
GET BACK TO
RIGHT OKAY
I THINK YOU CAN EMAIL ME IF THERE'S ANY MORE QUESTIONS
UM AND I'LL BE ABLE TO NOT ANSWER THEM
I'LL WAIT UNTIL YOU'RE ALL UM HOOKED UP
OH GOOD GRIEF
'KAY
OKAY
OH
THANKS
PUT IT ON IN THAT WAY
OOPS
OKAY
MM
WELCOME BACK EVERYBODY HOPE YOU'VE HAD FUN
AFTER LUNCH
YEAH
RIGHT UM THIS IS OUR CONCEPTUAL DESIGN MEETING UM I THINK WE'RE SLIGHTLY AHEAD OF OURSELVES
MM-HMM
FROM THE LAST MEETING I TH I I THINK YEAH UM
YEAH YEAH I WAS GETTING THAT IMPRESSION AS WELL
MM-HMM
MM
THIS IS WHERE WE TALK ABOUT UM PROPERTIES MATERIALS USER INTERFACE AND TREND WATCHING
ETCETERA
MM-HMM
SO I THINK WE'VE TOUCHED ON A FEW THINGS
TO DO WITH THAT ALREADY BUT WE'LL JUST GO OVER IT
UM
THE MINUTES FROM THE LAST TIME
UM WE HAD A COUPLE OF UM CHANGES IN OUR PLANS IN THAT WE COULDN'T USE TELETEXT
IT WASN'T GONNA BE A CONTROL FOR EVERYTHING UM AND THAT WE HAD TO INCORPORATE THE IMAGE OF THE COMPANY INTO IT SOMEHOW
UM
WE WERE THINKING A SHELL BUT SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES JUST A DIFFERENT SHAPE FROM WHAT'S NORMAL UM
WE HAVE DECIDED ON A LEAVING OUT THE VOICE RECOGNITION WE'VE DECIDED ON THERE BEING A FLIP DESIGN AND UM A DIFFERENT SHAPE FROM WHAT'S NORMAL
YOU WERE GOING TO LOOK INTO THE RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES
YEAH
YES IF YOU FEEL
UM AND OUR MARKET WAS GOING TO BE YOUNG BUSINESS KIND OF RANGE
OKAY SO SHALL WE START WITH THE FIRST PRESENTATION
AND WE WERE GONNA THINK ABOUT THE PORT AND AN ALARM FOR GETTING IT LOST THINGS LIKE THAT
YEAH
'KAY
OKAY
WE JUST CONNECT UP
SHALL I
YEP
THANK YOU
THERE WE GO
OKAY UM SO WE DECIDED ON OUR MARKET AND SO THIS FEEDBACK FROM THE MARKETING DEPARTMENT IS REALLY ABOUT TREND WATCHING
UM
THE METHODS WE USED TO DECIDE ON UH
SO THAT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS WE DID
SORRY PROJECT MANAGER
ALSO WITH OUR COMPANY UM BEING FORERUNNERS IN UH PUTTING FASHION INTO TECHNOLOGY
WERE THAT WE DID OUR TRADITIONAL UH OUR USUAL MARKET RESEARCH STUDY UH WITH A HUNDRED SUBJECTS AND THE THE GENERAL FEEDBACK FROM THEM IS THAT THE MOST IM UH W I'M SORRY I'M SLIGHTLY TONGUE TIED AFTER LUNCH
UM WE DECIDED ON THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT I UH REQUIRED IN A REMOTE CONTROL DEVICE AND WE'LL COME TO THAT LATER
CURRENT TRENDS AND SO ON MARKET TRENDS
WE ALSO LOOKED AT A FASHION UPDATE UM USING OUR CONSULTANTS ON FASHION AND DESIGN IN PARIS AND MILAN
IT'S OKAY
UH SO THE GENERAL FINDINGS FROM THAT WAS UH IN THE MARKET TRENDS THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT FOR REMOTE CONTROLS WERE PEOPLE WANT A FANCY LOOK AND FEEL
RATHER THAN THE THE CURRENT FUNCTIONAL LOOK AND FEEL OF REMOTE CONTROLS
THEY ALSO ALSO WANT A REMOTE CONTROL TO BE TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE
AND OF COURSE AS WE PREDICTED THAT IT SHOULD BE EASY TO USE
IS TWICE AS IMPORTANT AS THE SECOND TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE WHICH IS IN TURN TWICE AS IMPORTANT AS BEING EASY TO USE
NOW I SHOULD POINT OUT THAT THE FIRST OF THOSE FINDINGS FANCY LOOK AND FEEL IS THE MOST IMPORTANT
BUT IT'S THIRD IN ORDER OF PREFERENCE FOR THE THE SUBJECT GROUP WE LOOKED AT
SO POSSIBLY THAT THE FEATURE THAT WE PUT FIRST IS ACTUALLY THIRD IS STILL IMPORTANT
SO SHOULD WE BE THINKING OF USING SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN OUR REMOTE CONTROL DESIGN TOO
UM WE FOUND FROM OUR UM CONSULTANTS IN PARIS AND MILAN WHO DES ATTENDED ALL THE DESIGN AND FASHION FAIRS THERE
OKAY UM NOW THE FASHION UPDATE WHICH RELATES TO VERY PERSONAL PREFERENCES AMONG OUR SUBJECT GROUP
THAT FRUIT AND VEGETABLES ARE GOING TO BE THE THEME FOR CLOTHES SHOES AND FURNITURE
YEAH
SO A LOT OF INTERESTING FEEDBACK THERE BOTH FROM OUR MARKET RESEARCH DEPARTMENTS AND FROM OUR PEOPLE IN PARIS AND MILAN
BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT OUR DESIGN PEOPLE MAKE OF THAT
THERE ALSO SEEMS TO BE UM A TREND TOWARDS A SPONGY FEEL TO MATERIALS UH AGAIN IN CONTRAST TO LAST YEAR
'KAY
OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH
UM
YEP
LET'S START FROM THE INSIDE AND WORK OUR WAY OUT
FINE
IT'S OKAY WITH ME
YEAH OKAY
'KAY
UNLESS ANYONE HAS ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT
NOT YET
I DON'T THINK SO NOT YET
UM YES THANK YOU
THAT SCREWED IN
OKAY
I HATE THOSE LITTLE THINGS
YEAH
ESPECIALLY IF YOU DO THEM ON TOO TIGHT AND YOU CAN'T GET THE LEVERAGE ON THEM TO UNDO THEM
I KNOW
'KAY
OKAY
UM THIS IS UH ALL ABOUT THE DESIGN OF THE ACTUAL COMPONENTS AND THE AVAILABILITY OF THE COMPONENTS WE HAVE IN STOCK AT THE MOMENT
OKAY FIRST UH THE
OKAY
INTO THE METHOD
UM ALSO IN THIS STUDY I'VE LOOKED INTO THE AVAILABILITY OF SOME OF THE MATERIALS
THE THE MAIN IDEA OF THE WHOLE THING IS JUST SO YOU SH YOU JUST PRESS BUTTONS AND IT SHOULD ACTIVATE THINGS ON THE T. V. AND WE DISCUSSED LAST MEETING THAT IT SHOULD BE EASY TO FIND
'CAUSE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE LOOKED AT LAST TIME AREN'T UN UNFORTUNATELY AREN'T AVAILABLE
'KAY
UM AND THEN WE WE'RE LOO LOOKING INTO BATTERY OPTIONS
UM FINDINGS I'VE GOT MY NICE LITTLE PICTURE THERE
THIS IS UH THE CHIP CALLED THE T. A. DOUBLE ONE EIGHT THREE FIVE WHICH IS WHAT'S USED IN PRETTY MUCH EVERY REMOTE CONTROL 'CAUSE IT SENDS OUT STANDARD SIGNALS
BASED ON YOUR INPUT AND UM IT'S PRETTY MUCH USED FOR ALL ALL T. V. REMOTES AT THE MOMENT
'KAY
THERE'S UM ACTUALLY NO RECHARGEABLE OPTION AVAILABLE
IT MIGHT
SO YOU WIND UP YOUR REMOTE CONTROL BEFORE YOU USE IT
SO WE I SAW THE UM THE STANDARD DOUBLE A. AND TRIPLE A. WHICH WE THOUGHT WERE A BIT BIT TOO BULKY AT THE MOMENT
DYNAMO CHARGING I THOUGHT THAT THAT MIGHT BE A BIT SILLY TO BE TO BE HONEST PEOPLE WON'T IT'S IT'S BASICALLY LIKE WIND UP RADIO
WA CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT
LIKE A RIGHT OKAY
OR
HOW WHAT KIND OF HOW L LONG CAN YOU GET OUT OF THAT
I MEAN CAN YOU PICK IT UP AND THEN WIND IT FOR TWO MINUTES AND THEN THAT'S IT FOR THE NIGHT
YOU
LIKE THE THE SOLAR CHARGING 'CAUSE MOST PEOPLE HAVE THE LIGHT ON IN THE ROOM ANYWAY SO THEY COULD GET WHEN WHEN YOU GOT T. V.
BUT I DON'T I DON'T THINK IT'S REALLY SORT OF NECESSARY WHEN YOU TH YOU THINK OF THE NEXT TWO OPTIONS
YEAH YEAH OH YEAH I PRESU YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO WIND IT FOR VERY LONG
THAT DOESN'T COUNT THOUGH DOES IT
DOES DOES LIGHT CHARGE AS AS SUNLIGHT DOES
ARTIFICIAL LIGHT
I THOUGHT IT WAS U. V. LIKE
NO
ALRIGHT I
IS IT
HAS TO BE SOLAR
ANY ANY
SO MAYBE A STANDARD TRIPLE A. MIGHT TAKE LESSER SPACE OR AND DYNAMO MIGHT TAKE MORE SPACE
REGARDING THOSE SIZES WHICH ONE YOU THINK WILL BE LIGHT BECAUSE WE WE HAVE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION SIZE ALSO
YEP
YEAH IT WOULD THE D YEAH THE DYNAMO WOULD TAKE MORE SPACE 'CAUSE YOU ACTUALLY NEED A PHYSICAL SORT OF HANDLE TO WIND UP
I'M PRETTY SURE THAT SOLAR IS FROM THE SUN
YEAH OKAY
MM
UH I DON'T THINK IT COUNTS ELECTRIC LIGHTS NO BUT I MEAN NOT MANY YOU DON'T WANT TO LIMIT YOUR MARKET
I MEAN PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN BASEMENT FLATS THERE'S NOT THAT MANY PEOPLE BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE
ARTIFICIAL LIGHT NO
THAT'S GOING TO
I KNOW DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORLD TOO IF WE'RE IF WE'RE MARKETING INTERNATIONALLY
UH
BUT
YEAH AND MOST PEOPLE MOST PEOPLE ALSO WATCH T. V. IN THE IN THE NIGHT ANYWAY
RIGHT
NIGHT
I THINK THE POINT IS THAT IT CHARGES THROUGH THE DAY AND THEN YOU'VE GOT IT CHARGED FOR THE EVENING
MM BUT THEN IT WOULD BE CHARGING THROUGH THE DAY
BUT I I THINK I THINK THE THE NEXT ONE'S THE BEST ANYWAY
I DON'T THINK YOU'D EVER NEED TO ACTUALLY PHYSICALLY START SHAKING IT UP TO MAKE IT WORK
I MEAN THE AMOUNT THE AMOUNT OF PROBABLY MOVING AROUND YOU'D BE DOING ALL THE TIME WOULD WOULD CHARGE IT UP
THE THE KINETIC CHARGING WHICH IS LIKE YOU GET IT IN R YOU GET IT IN WRIST WATCHES AND YOU D YOU DON'T EVEN NOTICE IT
OKAY
YEAH I'VE SEEN
AND ARE THESE LIKE UH WHAT ARE THE LIFE OF THE KINETIC BATTERY IT LIKE IT RUNS FOR LONG TIME
UM YEAH IT'S IT CHARGES INTO UM SOME FORM OF IT'S A SMALLER CELL WHICH IT CHARGES INTO AND UH THE SI THE SIZE SORT OF A WATCH A WATCH BATTERY
AND THAT'LL THAT WOULD L WOULD LAST FOR UM WELL I DO I D I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE HOW LONG IT WOULD LAST BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE RUN OUT
'CAUSE THEY USE THEM QUITE FREQUENTLY IN WATCHES
MM-HMM
OKAY
THEN YOU PICK IT UP TO CHANGE IT AND THEN YOU PUT IT ON THE SIDE
YOU'RE DOING THINGS IT IS MOVING A LOT OF THE TIME
BUT THEN IF YOU THINK ABOUT A WATCH IT'S ON YOUR WRIST SO IT'S ON YOUR WHOLE BOD IT'S ON YOUR BODY THE WHOLE TIME SO YOU'RE WALKING AROUND
IS IT REALLY GONNA BE ENOUGH
IF YOU'D I MEAN YOU SWITCH THE T. V. ON THEN YOU PUT IT ON THE SIDE
WE C
YEAH
YEAH AND
MM-HMM
AND TH FOR THE SAME THE SAME REASON
ALTHOUGH IT'S ONLY A TINY AMOUNT IT'S IT'S UM IT'S ALWAYS MOVING FOR THE WHOLE DAY AND THEY DON'T RUN OUT OVER NIGHT WHEN YOU LEAVE THEM ON THE SIDE
YEAH BUT THEN AGAIN I I THINK IT IS BECAUSE IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT THE WATCH
YOU'RE ONLY USING IT FOR A V INCREDIBLY SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME JUST TO SEND THE SIGNAL AND THEN YOU'RE FINISHED WITH IT AND YOU PUT IT NO NO I DO I DON'T THINK THE THE DRAW ON IT WOULD BE
OKAY
HMM
MM-HMM
COULD I JUST ASK REFERRING BACK TO SOLAR CHARGING IS THAT COMPATIBLE WITH UM STANDARD BATTERIES
I MEAN
COULD PEOPLE PUT STANDARD BATTERIES IN BUT WITH A S YOU KNOW THEY COULD LEAVE IT IN THE SUNLIGHT FOR SOLAR CHARGING OR THE TWO THINGS NOT COMPATIBLE
MM
SO IT'S NOT THE DRAW ON IT ISN'T
OKAY
MM
IF YOU LIE ON A CALCULATOR THEY THEY'RE QUI THEY'RE QUITE BIG AND THEY ALL THEY ALL LOOK I IDENTICAL
YE YEAH I THINK I TH UH G Y YOU COULD HAVE A DUAL UM POWER THING BUT THE THE THING WITH THE SOLAR CELLS IS YOU WOULD NEED TO PUT THEM ON THE CASE AND THEY BECAUSE
LIKE A DUAL KIND OF
MM
SO THAT AFFECTS THE EXTERIOR DESIGN
SOLAR WOULD BE SLIGHTLY EXPENSIVES
WHAT KIND OF PRICE ARE WE LOOKING AT FOR I PRESUME THE NORMAL BATTERIES ARE THE CHEAPEST
EXPENSIVE AS WELL
THEY'RE THEY'RE EXPENSIVE THEY DON'T
IT'S TWELVE POINT F
YEAH THE NORMAL BATTERIES WOULD BE THE CHEAPEST I'D PRESUME THEN IT WOULD ACTUALLY BE THE THE SOLAR CHARGING ONES UM BUT THE
SO
'CAUSE IF YOU DROP STUFF YEAH IF YOU IF YOU HAVE Y THE SIZE YOU'D NEED TO CHARGE A REMOTE WOULDN'T BE THAT BIG BUT I MEAN IF REMOTES ALWAYS GET THROWN AROUND AND STUFF
IT'S I I THINK THEY'RE NOT VERY RESISTANT TO DROPPING
SOLAR
WELL THEY'RE NOT DESIGNED
Y I THINK YEAH PRACTICALLY
PRACTICAL WISE OKAY
I MEAN CALCULATORS YOU DON'T REALLY THROW AROUND A LOT WHEREAS REMOTES YOU DO THEY CAN T
YOU DO GET A BIT OF WEAR BUT DON'T CALCULATORS HAVE A BATTERY IN THEM AS WELL
YEAH THEY DO THEY YEAH THEY'VE GOT DUAL THINGS BUT THEY'RE THE BATTERIES ARE SMALLER I THINK
MM
MM
W W WHICH ONE WOULD LAST THE LONGEST BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT CUSTOMERS TO BE LIKE YOU KNOW CHARGING LIKE A MOBILE PHONE EVERY DAY
ANOTHER QUESTION IS LIKE SORRY
AGAIN IT DE
W M YEAH SO THE
MM
A REMOTE CONTROL LIKE SO WE HAVE TO S LOOK AT THE LIFE ALSO
MM
YEAH THE THE S IF YOU IF YOU HAD SOMETHING DU UH USING THE STANDARD
BATTERIES AND THE SOLAR CHARGING UM
I DON'T THINK YOU'D I THINK THE IT WOULD D WELL YOU KNOW HOW LONG THE STANDARD DOUBLE A. S WOULD LAST IN OR TRIPLE A. S WOULD LAST
IT WOULD JUST DETRACT FROM THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF THE OF THE WHOLE FEATURE I IT'S NOT GONNA ADD ANYTHING OKAY
YEAH I THINK I I THINK IT WOULD YEAH
OKAY CAN WE ADD IN UH AN ATTACHMENT TO CLOSING FEATURE
OKAY
'CAUSE IF WE'RE DOING THE KINETIC THING AND IT'S
CAN WE THINK ABOUT THAT
YEAH
SHOULDN'T WE DO SOME MARKET RESEARCH ON THAT FIRST BEFORE WE ADD IT IN BECAUSE I I PERSONALLY RIGHT OKAY
WELL ADD IT IN TO THINK ABOUT UM
BECAUSE
YOU YOU WOULDN'T LOSE IT SO MUCH
WHERE AM I
IF IT IS THE KINETIC THING AND IT IS SMALL AND IT IS PORTABLE AND IT IS A DIFFERENT SHAPE AND THE KINETIC IS SOMETHING PEOPLE DON'T DO KIND OF WE'RE DOING SOMETHING ORIGINAL AND DIFFERENT UM BUT IF YOU WORE IT IF IT'S SOMETHING YOU COULD JUST CLIP ON YOUR POCKET THEN YOU WOULD HAVE THAT LESS
YEAH
YEAH
BUT THEN MAYBE THAT'S LOOKING AT SOMEONE WHO'S JUST SITTING ON THEIR OWN RATHER THAN
YEAH
THE ETERNAL BATTLE FOR CONTROL OF THE CONTROLS
IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S COME UP IN ANY OF OUR UH FOCUS GROUPS AND MARKET RESEARCH IT'S NOT A THING THAT PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR
NO
OKAY
WHEN WE THREW IT OPEN TO THE FIELD YEAH
SO
OKAY
BUT IT'S SOMETHING TO PUT ON THE SIDE TO THINK ABOUT MAYBE
OKAY RIGHT
OKAY WELL I'LL MOVE ON
MM-HMM
WHICH BASICALLY HAS THESE CONTACTS THAT ARE REALLY CLOSE TOGETHER AND THEN WHEN YOU PRESS DOWN ON THE RUBBER BUTTON
UM MY SECOND PART OF MY FINDINGS UH THE MO MOST CURRENT REMOTES USE THIS SILICONE UH P. C. B. BOARD WHICH PR PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD
IT'LL CONNECT THE CIRCUIT AND EACH EACH SWITCH IS CONNECTED TO TWO UH DIFFERENT LEGS ON THE CHIP AND SO SENDS A DIFFERENT MESSAGE AND THAT THEN UH GETS TRANSLATED BY THE CHIP INTO A CODE AND THEN IT'S FIRED OUT OF THIS L. E. D. IN THE SEQUENCE OF L ON AND OFF BURSTS
CAN WE WHAT KIND OF SIZE DOES IT COME IN VARYING SIZES OR IS IT JUST ONE SIZE AND WE WOULD HAVE TO FIT THE DESIGN OF
WHAT KIND OF THINGS DO WE HAVE TO CONSIDER THERE
WELL
WELL THIS THE THI THE THING ABOUT IS UM
IF YOU IF YOU WANTED TO BUT UM THE THERE IS AN OPTION TO DO TO DO IT LIKE THAT OR YOU COULD HAVE SOME SORT OF
IF YOU IF YOU SEE HOW THIN THE TRACKS ARE
YOU COULD YOU COULD S YOU COULD PUT THEM VIRTUALLY RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHER AND HAVE A MUCH SMALLER SWITCH ON EACH ONE
THEY THEY CAN BE AS BIG OR AS SMALL AS YOU WANT THEM TO BE BECAUSE YOU CAN YOU CAN PRINT CIRCUIT BOARD LIKE THAT THAT IT'S IT'S SIMPLY SPACED LIKE THAT SO YOU CAN HAVE FIT THE N THE SIZE OF THE NINE BUTTONS IN
MM-HMM
OKAY
ARRAY OF SWITCHES WHICH I'LL SPEAK ABOUT IN THE NEXT BIT SO THAT
OKAY
BUT YOU COULD YOU COULD HAVE LIGHTS BEHIND THE BUTTONS AND UM AFTER LIKE FIVE OR TEN SECONDS OF NOT BEING USED I'D HAVE THAT TURNED OFF
IF WE DECIDED TO GO FOR BUTTONS THAT COULD LIGHT UP
AND THEN TO UH YEAH SO TO CONSERVE BATTERY LIFE THE REMOTE SHOULD BE IN A STANDBY MODE NO WHILE NOT BEING USED
SO YOU CAN SEE WHAT ALL THE BUTTONS ARE LIKE ON A MOBILE PHONE THEY DO IT MORE OFTEN THAN ON A THAN ON A T. V. REMOTE
NOW WHAT I WAS THINKING ABOUT THAT WAS 'CAUSE SOMETIMES WHEN Y WHEN YOU HAVE THESE THINGS THEY'VE GOT LITTLE LIGHTS ON BEHIND THE BUTTONS
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OKAY
UM THE CASE MATERIAL I'VE A BEEN SENT WHAT THE FACTORY CAN ACTUALLY GIVE US
THE THERE'S THE PLASTIC WHICH I THINK WE WERE GONNA GO FOR ANYWAY AS THE MAIN CASE CASE HOUSING AND
MM-HMM
WELL YOU'RE SAYING THAT PEOPLE LIKE THIS UH SPONGY FEEL THIS YEAR SO PERHAPS UH SOME SOMETHING MADE OF RUBBER
TITANIUM UM VERY EXPENSIVE JUST TO PROCESS WHICH TO MAKE IT IS EXPENSIVE AND RUBBER
THE THE MAIN PROBLEMS WITH THE WELL YOU COULD GO FOR WOOD BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE A BIT IMPRACTICAL
BUT I WAS THINKING MORE OF THE BUTTONS BECAUSE THE BUTTONS WHICH THEY'VE THEY'VE SAID
MM
MM
THAT THEY'VE THEY'VE PUT ACROSS
UM THE PROBLEM WITH THE CASING IS THAT UH THERE'S
I'M NO I'M NOT SURE HOW THAT WOULD WORK BECAUSE SURELY YOUR FINGERS WOULD STILL BE MOVING OVER THE SHORT DISTANCES BUT THAT'S WHAT THEY SAID
ARE WHAT IS USED IN SOME STRESS BALL MANUFACTURE AND IT'S MEANT TO BE ANTI R. S. I.
OKAY
MM-HMM
IF YOU GO FOR TITANIUM THEY CAN ONLY DO A STANDARD BOX SHAPE
QUITE UM THERE'S QUITE A FEW DESIGN RESTRICTIONS THAT THEY'VE GOT ON THE SHAPE OF THE CASE
WHEREAS IF YOU COME TO PLASTIC THEY CAN THEY CAN BE A LITTLE MORE THEY CAN THEY CAN DO SORT OF CURVED SHAPES
BUT WHETHER WHETHER OR NOT BECAUSE WE'D HAVE IT IN TWO SEPARATE UNITS
SO IS THAT FEATURE AVAILABLE IN LIKE UH TITANIUM OR IT'S LIKE ONLY SPECIFIC TO PLASTIC OR
SECOND THING IS YEAH AND SECOND QUESTION IS LIKE A MOBILE YOU CAN CHANGE THE COVER YOU CALL IT A SKIN OR WHATEVER
SO IN THIS CASE IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT LIKE A CUSTOMER CAN CHANGE THE COLOUR LIKE FROM GREEN PARROT GREEN TO CHILLI RED OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
FOR THE FLIP PHONE
HINGED YEAH
YEAH
MM
YEAH I TH
UH
BECAUSE OF THE EXPENSE OF HOW MUCH TITANIUM IS IS IT'S LIGHT AND STRONG BUT I THINK IT SHOULD BE LEFT FOR AIRCRAFT DESIGN RATHER THAN FOR
THE JU JUST IT W WELL YOU COULD MAKE IT AVAILABLE IN THE TITANIUM
IT WAS JUST IT WOULD BE SO EXPENSIVE TO BUY A NEW CASE FOR IT
YEAH IN IN TITANIUM I DON'T I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE AVAILABLE AT ALL REALLY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
I WAS JUST WONDERING IF WE MAKE THE BASIC MOULD OUT OF PLASTIC BUT HAVE LIKE A RUBBER COVER THAT GOES OVER
THAT WOULD GIVE THE SPONGY FEEL THAT ALSO ALLOWS US TO KIND OF HAVE DIFFERENT FASCIAE FOR THE PHONE
IT DOES MARK QUITE EASILY TOO IF YOU LET IT FALL
I'VE GOT A MOBILE PHONE MYSELF WHICH IS TITANIUM AND IT DOES MARK VERY EASILY IF YOU DROP IT
FOR A REMOTE
YEAH YEAH
RUBBER YEAH
AND YOU CAN PEEL THEM OFF YEAH
SO INSTEAD OF THE FASCIA THAT COMES OFF BEING PLASTIC THE FASCIA THAT COMES OFF WOULD BE THE RUBBER
LIKE THOSE PENS THAT YOU GET WITH THE GRIP THAT YOU CAN YOU CAN PULL THAT OFF
YEAH
LIKE A RUBBER SLEEVE ALMOST YEAH
YEAH
SOMETHING LIKE
YEAH
MM
THAT COULD BE A GOOD IDEA
ALRIGHT
MM
HMM
IT COULD IT WOULD BE COMFORTABLE TO HOLD ON ALSO
OKAY
MM
VERY CHEAP WAY OF CHANGING THE LOOK OF IT AND PEOPLE CAN JUST BUY A NEW ONE IF THEY WANT TO
T
YEAH
WELL THAT'S BEEN REALLY POPULAR WITH MOBILE PHONES SO I DON'T SEE WHY NOT
MM
YEAH
NOW WHAT I WAS SAYING BEFORE ABOUT INSTEAD OF HAVING YOU COULD HAVE JUST A BARE P. C. B. CIRCUIT BOARD AND I'M SURE YOU COULD PROBABLY GET IT IN DIFFERENT COLOURS AND SO JUST BY TOUCHING IT WITH YOUR FINGER IT'D MAKE THE CONNECTION
ALSO THE JUST JUST GOING BACK TO THE INTERFACE DESIGNS WITH THE BUTTONS THE I KNO WE WERE PLANNING TO DO SOME SORT OF TOUCH SCREEN
'KAY
MM-HMM
UM THE SECOND OPTION TH THEY OFFER RUBBER BUTTONS
BUT I THOUGHT THAT AN L. C. D. TYPE OF SCREEN 'CAUSE ONE THEY'RE INCREDIBLY THIN UM AND DON'T TAKE UP MUCH SPACE
TWO THEY YOU CAN HAVE THEM IN A SORT OF ARRAY AND YOU CAN ARRANGE THE BUTTONS ON THE SCREEN IN A SORT OF SET THING AND YOU COULD HAVE THEM LIKE A TOUCH
OVER IF YOU HAD THEM CLOSE ENOUGH THAT WOULD BE ONE OPTION
SORRY I DIDN'T GET THE LAST PART YOU'RE TALKING OF
DISPLAY
UH WHAT WHAT
JUST WHAT YOU SAID I I DIDN'T GET THE UH MEANING OF IT COMPLETELY YOU'RE SAYING LIKE
OH ON THE ON THE L. C. D. SCREEN YOU COULD BECAU YOU COULD FIT IT THE PROBLEM WITH IT BASICALLY IS THAT IT'S FLAT AND SO YOU CAN'T DO LOTS OF CURVE CURVED THINGS WITH IT
BUT UM YOU CAN YOU WOULDN'T HAVE WITH THE L. C. D. YOU'D HAVE THE WIRES COMING OFF YOU WOULDN'T HAVE THAT WITH THE
UH-HUH
OKAY
MM-HMM
WITH THE L. C. D. YOU'D ONLY HAVE THAT WITH THE PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD
MM
WITH
W ALSO WITH THE
IF WE FOR EXAMPLE HAD A SHELL ONCE WE OPEN THAT YEAH SO IT'D BE F YEAH YEAH
I DON'T S SORRY TO INTERRUPT I DON'T SEE WHY THE CURVED THING IS A PROBLEM
YEAH
OH IT WOULD BE FLAT INSIDE
YOU COULD HAVE A FLAT SCREEN INSIDE YEAH BUT I'M JUST WONDERING WHETHER WE WANT AN L. C. D. SCREEN INSIDE
SO YOU WOULDN'T BE PRESSING DOWN ON 'EM W OR WE COULD HAVE RUBBER BUTTONS WHICH ARE MADE OF THIS MATERIAL WHICH IS ANTI R. S. I.
IT WOULDN'T BE LIKE FULL COLOUR IT WOULD JUST BE BLACK AND WHITE BUT THERE'D BE TOUCH TOUCH BUTTONS
MM
HAVE I MISUNDERSTOOD YOU
MM-HMM
'KAY
MM-HMM
NOW HOW WOULD YOU DISTINGUISH IF YOU HAD IT BARE HOW WOULD YOU DISTINGUISH WHERE YOU HAD TO PRESS I MEAN
IF THE WHOLE THING IS GONNA BE THIS RUBBER THING IT WOULD BE GOOD TO OPEN IT UP AND SEE SOMETHING QUITE FANCY LOOKING INSIDE
I THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD TO HAVE A CONTRAST BETWEEN
IS RUBBER
YEAH
MM
YEAH I HADN'T I HADN'T REALLY THOUGHT OF THAT TO BE HONEST
UH
MM
IS IT POSSIBLE JUST AS AN OPTION WHEN WE OPEN IT UP PEOPLE CAN USE THEIR FINGERS TO PRESS THE BUTTON
I JUST HAD ANOTHER IDEA I DON'T KNOW IF IT HELPS WITH THAT BUT JUST TO DO WITH THE R. S. I.
OR WE HAVE INSIDE LIKE A SMALL POINTER THING WHEN PEOPLE WANT TO
YOU COULD HAVE SOME SORT OF STYLUS THAT YOU COULD PULL OUT BUT I I THINK THEY COULD GET A BIT EASILY LOST 'CAUSE I HAD
YEAH YOU COULD
LIKE ONE OF THE PALM POP THING
THEY'RE EASY TO REPLACE AS WELL CHEAP
YEAH
IF YOU KEEP PUNCHING WITH AN POINTER OR WHATEVER
IF HE WOULD A PERSON WHO SWITCHES CHANNELS VERY OFTEN OR DOES USE A PARTICULAR FUNCTION VERY OFTEN WILL FIND IT VERY IRRITATING TO USE A AND HE MIGHT SPOIL THE TOUCH PAD VERY FAST COMPARED TO A BUTTON LIKE
ABSOLUTELY F FOR SOMEBODY WHO VERY OFTEN
IT WOULD HAVE TO BE ATTACHED
HMM
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM
YEAH OKAY
A PENCIL OR A PEN SO THEY WOULDN'T REALLY NEED A
YEAH JUST A THOUGHT THEY WOULDN'T ACTUALLY NEED ONE AND THEY COULD USE ANYTHING THEY'VE GOT COULDN'T THEY
OKAY WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT SO IF YOU FINISH YOUR AND WE'LL COME BACK TO THAT
THAT'S YOU RIGHT OKAY
YEAH THAT'S YEAH THAT THAT'S THE END OF M MY
SO WE CAN DIVIDE THE CIRCUIT LIKE YOU KNOW
AND JUST ONE SMALL QUESTION BEFORE LIKE YOU ARE REGARDING THE CIRCUIT SINCE WE ARE HAV HAVING A FLIP TOP
WE CAN CUSTOMISE THE TWO CIRCUITS FOR DIFFERENT TYPE OF BUTTONS LIKE WE ARE KEEPING THE STANDARD BUTTONS ON THE TOP AND THE MORE COMPLEX BUTTONS UNDER THIS THING
YEAH
UH YEAH
'CAUSE IN THE IN THE ACTUAL FLIP BIT YOU'D HAVE SOME LINKING
I MEAN YOU'D YOU'D ACTUALLY HAVE TWO SEPARATE YOU'D HAVE TWO SEPARATE CIRCUIT BOARDS BUT THEY'D BE JOINED BY WIRES OR LIKE SOME CABLING BETWEEN THEM
YEAH YEAH THAT THAT WOULD BE FAIRLY SIMPLE
MM-HMM
OKAY
OKAY
MM-HMM
NOW YOU KNOW HOW YOU'VE GOT SOME MIRRORS IN NIGHTCLUBS THAT ARE MIRRORS WHEN YOU TURN TO THEM AND YOU TURN AWAY AND IT GIVES LIKE AN ADVERTISING DISPLAY
I'LL JUST RAISE ANOTHER POINT WHILE IT OCCURS TO ME IT KIND OF APPLIES TO BOTH OUR DESIGNERS HERE SO I'M NOT SURE HOW IT WOULD FIT IN
YOU SEEN THOSE
IF WE FLIP OPEN
MM
NO
AND THEY KIND OF RESPOND TO THE TURN OF YOUR BODY
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT WHEN WE OPEN OUR FLIP TOP SHELL IT'S A LITTLE COMPACT MIRROR AND WHEN YOU PRESS A BUTTON IT THEN GOES ONTO THE PHONE DISPLAY TH UH THE REMOTE CONTROL DISPLAY THING
WE'RE MARKETING TO GUYS AS MUCH AS WE ARE TO WOMEN
UM
THEY DON'T LOOK AT THEMSELVES
JUST A THOUGHT
YOU WERE SITTING WATCHING T. V. ARE YOU GONNA WANT TO SORT OF OPEN IT AND SAY OH SHIT I SHOULD GO AND HAVE A SHOWER AND DO MY HAIR BEFORE I PUT THE T.
WELL IT'S A REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN
TRYING TO THINK OF OTHER FEATURES WE CAN BUILD IN THAT WOULDN'T COST TOO MUCH BUT MAYBE WE'LL LEAVE THAT ONE ON THE SIDE
IT'S WITH US USING THE IDEAS FOR A MOBILE PH IT'S WITH US USING THE IDEAS FOR MOBILE PHONES I KINDA GOT SIDETRACKED ONTO THAT I THINK
OKAY
YEAH NO NO
MM
YEAH
'KAY
OKAY
I MEAN YOU CAN YOU COULD DO IT
BUT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU COULD GET ANY MIRROR EFFECT ON IT I'M NOT SURE ABOUT
YOU COULD HAVE A 'CAUSE IF YOU IF YOU JUST PUT THE FULL CHARGE THROUGH AN L. C. D. DISPLAY IT'LL COMPLETELY BLANK IT OUT
MM
OH I THINK FORGET ABOUT THE MIRROR THAT WAS JUST A VERY QUICK PASSING THOUGHT YEAH
OKAY OKAY
OKAY UH
ESPECIALLY FROM THE MARKETING AND INDUSTRIAL DESIGN TO CHECK ON THE CUSTOMER NEEDS AND FEASIBILITY
FIRST THING IS UH BASICALLY ON DESIGN WE JUST TOOK THE INPUT FROM THE PREVIOUS MEETING
WOULD LIKE TO SHARE SOMETHING WHICH I DID HERE
SO YOU GENERALLY SEE RECTANGULAR SHAPE VERY MONOTONOUS KIND OF DESIGNS HERE
SECOND IS WE CHECKED INTO COMPETITORS THE PICTURE HERE SHOWS ONE OF THE STANDARD MODELS OFFERED BY COMPETITORS HERE
SO Y YOU GENERALLY SEE THERE'S NOT MUCH OF VARIETY AND LIKE MARKETING TEAM SAID UH PEOPLE NEED TRENDY THEY ARE BORED OF BLACK AND WHITE
MM
YEAH
NO PARTICULAR REMOTE IS STANDARD
AND UH SECOND THING IS THERE'S TOO MUCH OF CONFUSION HERE
MM
LIKE SOME SOME PEOPLE HAVE A
HERE YOU SEE THIS
THIS IS ON A I I
I FOUND TH THAT UH ONLY COMMON FEATURE IS THE CH UH CHANNEL CONTROL AND UH VOLUME CONTROL
REST OTHER BUTTONS THEY ARE IN A VERY DISORGANIZED AND THEY ARE NOT CONSISTENT TH WITH OTHER MODELS AND ALL
OKAY
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE M MAYBE A G. G. U. I. INTERFACE IN THE F IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLIP TOP AND G GRAPHIC USER INTERFACE BASICALLY WHICH IS WHAT WE D DO IN COMPUTER
OKAY AND SECOND AS ALREADY DISCUSSED WITH WILLIAM
HAVE ICONS OR TOUCH PAD OR WHATEVER WHICH IS
YEAH
SORRY WHAT DOES THAT STAND FOR
WHICH MEANS
OKAY
YEAH
IF YOU IF YEAH IF YOU HAVE LIKE BUTTONS THAT APPEAR ON THE SCREEN IN THIS L. C. D. SCREEN
LIKE YOU HAVE ON A L UH ICONS OR SOMETHING Y YOU HAVE IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF G. U. I. GRAPHIC USER INTERFACE
YEAH
OKAY
SO BASICALLY NOT POINT OR CLICK
SO HE NEED NOT USE A POINTER TO KEEP CHANGING THE CHANNEL IF A PERSON IS FREQUENT SURFER
PRESS ANY PARTICULAR DEVICE HE JUST HAS TO CLICK ON THAT PARTICULAR ICON TO SIMPLIFY
AND ON THE TOP M REPETITIVE BUTTONS WHICH ARE LIKE VOLUME OR CHANNEL CHANGING AND ALL COULD BE ON THE POINTING DEVICE THAT MEANS THE USE OF BUTTON
OKAY
MM-HMM
SO WE ARE HAVING A COMBINATION OF BOARDS SO F ON THE S SIMPLER BOARD
ON THE TOP WE HAVE THIS BUTTON RUBBER BUTTONS TO KEEP FREQUENTLY CHANGING THE CHANNELS
CAN WE SWAP THAT ROUND SO TH THAT THE ONES THAT WE USE ALL THE TIME ARE ON THE BOTTOM PART
'CAUSE IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT HOLDING IT
YOU WOULD BE USING YOUR THUMBS TO PRESS JUST LIKE A MOBILE PHONE
YEAH
NO YOU'D HOLD IT YOU DON'T IF YOU FLIP IT OPEN THEN YOU'D BE
YOU'VE GOT YOUR L. C. D. DISPLAY THERE AND YOU'VE GOT THE BUTTONS THERE SO YOU'RE HOLDING IT IN THE PALM OF YOUR HAND YEAH
YOU US IF WE JUST USE THE SHELL AS AN EXAMPLE AGAIN YOU OPEN THAT
WOULDN'T YOU
ISN'T THAT THE IDEA
YEAH
YEAH YEAH BUT YOU CAN DO IT WITH YOUR THUMB LI
THAT'S WHAT I WAS JUST SAYING AND THEN HAVE THE AND THEN HAVE THE L. C. D. AT THE TOP AND THEN BE ABLE TO TOUCH THAT FOR THE OTHER CONTROLS
OKAY
SO HAVE THE UM THE VOLUME AND THE PROGRAMME THINGS LIKE THAT ON THE LOWER SIDE
BUT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OKAY AND YOU MEAN TO THE
AND THE LOWER DISTANCE
OH F PERFECT
HMM
SO THE FINDINGS ARE TOO MANY CLUTTERED BUTTONS
REPETITION OF CERTAIN BUT BUTTONS WHICH I ALREADY EXPLAINED EXAMPLE THE VOLUME AND CHANNEL CONTROL BUTTONS
OKAY WE HAD A LATEST FINDING OF VOICE RECOGNITION THERE WAS A MAIL
ALL ARE CONFUSING AND IN INCONSISTENT
SO IT COULD BE LIKE WHERE IS THE REMOTE AND THE REMOTE ANSWERS I AM HERE
AND TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE ALSO
SOME KIND OF THING OR IT GIVES A B BLEEP SOUND OR SOME KIND OF SOUND AND IF THIS CAN BE INCORPORATED THIS WOULD BE MORE UH YOU CAN SAY TRENDY ALSO
WE HAVE TO CHECK INTO THE FOR FINANCIAL F FEASIBILITY WHETHER WE CAN INCORPORATE IT THIS AT A LOW COST
BUT FOR LIKE WE HAD G UM S RESPONSE FROM THE CUSTOMERS THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE FEATURE OF FINDING IT
WHICH MENTIONS THAT OUR DIVISION HAS DEVELOPED A NEW SPEECH RECOGNITION S FEATURE
YEAH
YEAH
MM
YEAH
SO WE WE CAN CHECK INTO THE FINANCIAL FEASIBILITY OF INCORPORATING THIS
THEY WANT SOMETHING TO DO WITH FRUIT SO I WOULDN'T SAY THE DESIGN SHOULD BE LIKE A FRUIT
BUT YEAH WE CAN TAKE INSPIRATION FROM FRUIT COLOURS LIKE THE VIBRANT COLOURS UH RED CHILLI UH
MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES WOULD BE LIKE AS ALREADY UH MARKETING DEPARTMENT
MM
YEAH
TOMATO RED OR WHATEVER AND SECOND THING IS CER CERTAIN STANDARD BUTTONS WE SHOULD HAVE LIKE FOR EXAMPLE I IF YOU SEE THE PREVIOUS SLIDE UH
WELL YEAH WE
I THINK MOST OF THE USERS WOULD NOW BE WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THIS CER CENTRAL PATTERN HERE
SO WE WE WE WOULD NOT CHANGE H THAT PARTICULAR PATTERN BECAUSE I THIS IS THE MOST CONSISTENT THING IN ALL REMOTE CONTROLS
YEAH
I CAN'T SEE THAT IS THAT PLAY AND STOP AND THINGS
SO KEEP THAT M THAT STANDARDISED BECAUSE THAT'S THE MOST COMMON FEATURE ACROSS ALL MODELS IF YOU LOOK AT ALL THE MODELS IT'S HERE
THIS IS CENTRAL ONE THE ONE YOU YEAH VOLUME AND CHANNEL
OR IS THAT VOLUME AND CHANNEL
THIS
AND
VOICE RECOGNITION
OKAY
RIGHT
UM
OKAY
I'M NOT SURE HOW LONG WE'VE GOT LEFT BUT WE NEED TO MAKE A DECISION ABOUT UM
THE THINGS WE'VE DISCUSSED
SO WE AGREE ON
DO WE AGREE ON THE BATTERY
KINETIC
THE KINETIC
UM THAT MEANS THAT THERE'S NO FUNCTION FOR LI THE PORT
IT'S A BI I IT'S LIKE A G IT'S A GADGET IT'S A
YOU KNOW THAT IT SITS IN THEN PRESSING THE BUTTON THEN HAVING SO WE COULD INCORPORATE VOICE RECOGNITION FOR THE FINDING IT
YEAH
YEAH
MM
YEAH I THINK I MEAN IF
THEN IT WON'T BE CHEAP TO RE MANUFACTURE THEM UH OR IT WILL BE CHEAP SORRY TO RE MANUFACTURE THEM
SO DO YOU RECKON THAT'S A GOOD IDEA THAT WHERE'S THE REMOTE I'M HERE THING
I THINK THAT WOULD BE QUITE FUN
YEAH IT IS IT IS QUI IT'S QUITE A COOL FEATURE TO HAVE AND ALSO IF THEY'VE GOT IT IF THEY'VE GOT THESE PARTS ALREADY IN STOCK
SELLING POINT
MM-HMM
MM
I THINK THE ONLY
BUT I THINK PRETTY MUCH WE'VE USED CHEAP RELATIVELY CHEAP AND SIMPLE THINGS
THE L. C. D. 'S NOT CHEAP
I THINK THE ONLY PITFALL THAT WE WOULD HAVE WOULD BE HOW MUCH IT'S GOING TO COST IF THAT MEANS WE HAVE TO CUT DOWN SOMEWHERE ELSE
YEAH
YEAH
MM
I MEAN THEY USE THEM IN CALCULATORS SO
YEAH TO S TH WELL IT'S IT'S NOT AS EXPENSIVE AS IT WOULD BE IF IT WAS FULL COLOUR 'CAUSE IF WE'VE JUST GOT A BLACK AND WHITE ONE
HMM
YEAH OKAY
MAYBE WE COULD START WITH THE BLACK AND WHITE
YEAH
THAT THAT WAY WE COULD UPGRADE LATER
AND YOU COULD YEAH
YEAH WE TALKED ABOUT KINETIC CHARGING WE'VE DECI SEEM TO HAVE DECIDED ON THAT DID WE DECIDE ON DOUBLE A. OR TRIPLE A. BATTERIES
OKAY
MM
MM
WELL YOU COU UM
DO YOU WANT LIKE A BACK UP
NO
ONE OF THE DECISIONS WE HAD TO MAKE WAS WHETHER WE HAD DOUBLE A. OR TRIPLE A. BATTERIES 'CAUSE THEY'VE STILL GOT TO BE CHARGED THIS WAY HAVEN'T THEY
I OH I SEE
K NO THE KINETIC ONES COME COME WITH UM A SORT OF W WATCH A BATTERY THAT GOES IN A WATCH
RIGHT OKAY GOT YOU
SO IT'S A LOT SMALLER SO IT WOULD
GOT YOU ON THAT OKAY DIDN'T REALISE
THE INSIDE COMPONENTS IS PRETTY STANDARDISED ACROSS THE BOARD ISN'T IT
UM OKAY SO WE'VE GOT BATTERY
YEAH
YEAH
SO THERE'S NOT A REALLY A DECISION TO BE MADE THERE UM
THE BUTTONS WHAT DID YOU GIVE US AS OUR
THE BARE BOARD L. C. D. OR
ON THE ON THE ON ON THE TOP ONE WE'RE GONNA YEAH
YEAH THE WELL I THINK WERE WE'RE GOING FOR THE L. C. D. ON THAT ONE ON THE BUTTONS
ON THE TOP ONE OKAY YOU'VE GOT THE TOUCH OKAY AND THEN
ON THE BOTTOM WE WERE GONNA HAVE THE RUBBER THE RUBBER ONES THE ANTI R. S. I. ONES
OKAY OKAY
SORRY COULD YOU REPEAT THAT LAST PART
UM OKAY ON WE'VE GOT THE FLIP THE FLIP SCREEN THE TOP ONE IS GONNA BE THE L. C. D. AND THE BOTTOM ONE IS GONNA BE THE RUBBERISED BUTTONS
L. C. D. SCREEN
MM-HMM
OKAY
AND FOR THE SORRY
NO IT'S FINE
FOR THE INSIDE AND UH RUBBER AS A PADDING OR FOR THE GRIP SOMETHING LIKE TO ADD TO THE DESIGN
FOR THE BODY DESIGN I THINK PLASTIC UH W YEAH WE COULD USE THE BODY
PLASTIC OKAY
FOR THE INSIDE
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM SO WE DECIDED ON A RUBBER CASING FOR THE PLASTIC SHELL A VARIETY OF DESIGNS OKAY
PLAST RIGHT
OH I THINK SO I THINK SO
AND IT IS JUST UH ALTHOUGH IT'S RUBBERISED AND SPONGY APART FROM THAT WE'RE JUST GOING TO GO FOR SORT OF VEGETABLE AND FRUIT COLOURS
WE'RE NOT GONNA TRY AND MAKE IT ACTUALLY A VEGETABLE OR FRUIT DESIGN OR ANYTHING ELSE LIKE A SHELL THAT WE DISCUSSED JUST GO FOR THE COLOURS
MM NO
SO WE COULD JUST PICK ANYTHING
NO I THINK I WE DON'T WANNA BE TACKY IF WE'VE GOT A KIND OF DIFFERENT SHAPE ANYWAY UM THE FACT THE M THE MATERIAL THAT WE WOULD BE USING WOULD BE CHEAP
WE COULD MAKE IT UM PSYCHEDELIC YOU KNOW WE COULD MAKE IT BLACK AND WHITE ZEBRA STRIPES
SO WE COULD MAKE IT RED
BUT THAT'S NOT REALLY WHAT WE'RE FOCUSING ON WHAT WE'RE FOCUSING ON IS THE M YOU KNOW YES
IT'S
OKAY
MM-HMM
THE FEEL
'KAY
MADE OF PLASTIC FITS INTO THE PALM OF THE HAND RUBBERISED COVER THAT'S SPONGY
MM-HMM
IS THAT REALLY GOING TO FIT FANCY LOOK AND FEEL WHICH WAS THE MAJOR THING THAT PEOPLE WANTED MARKET RESEARCH IS THAT FANCY
IS THAT GOING TO BE THIS IMAGE I'VE GOT IN MY HEAD OF SOMETHING KIND OF SHAPED LIKE THAT MAYBE ABOUT THAT SIZE
WHICH IS WHAT'S ON THE MARKET ANYWAY
OR YOU WANT SOMETHING THAT CONTRASTS AS YOU KNOW LIKE YOU GET CLOCKS NOW THAT ARE MORE OF A TALKING POINT THAN AN ACTUAL CLOCK BECAUSE THEY'RE SO INTERESTING AND
SORT OF BEIGE AND BLACK UM SO YOU EITHER WANT SOMETHING THAT GOES WITH THAT
IT'S JUST DIFFERENT IT'S JUST DIFFERENT FROM EVERYTHING ELSE AND I MEAN I'M TRYING TO IMAGINE UM CLEAN LOOKING HOUSES
UH I IT'S DIFFERENT
MM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM
MM-HMM
YEAH
I'M JUST KIND OF PUSHING AT THAT TO SEE IF YOU CAME OUT WITH ANYTHING ELSE BUT I MEAN I TOTALLY AGREE
THIS WOULD DEFINITELY BE DIFFERENT ENOUGH I JUST WONDERED IF ANYBODY COULD COME UP WITH SOMETHING EVEN MORE
WE LOOKED AT THOSE REMOTES I MEAN THEY ARE KIND OF ANONYMOUS VERY SIMILAR LOOKING THINGS
MM
YOU COULD HAVE UM A PLAIN BLACK ONE YOU COULD HAVE SPARKLY PINK GLITTERY ONES FOR YOUR LITTLE
AND YOU WOULD JUST HAVE AN ACROSS THE B YOU WOULD HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT OPTIONS THAT YOU COULD DO
WELL THE THING IS THE RUBBERISED COVERS ARE GOING TO BE S RELATIVELY CHEAP TO PRODUCE
THAT IF IN A YEAR'S TIME WE WE GET FEEDBACK FROM THE DESIGN FAIRS THAT SHOW SOMETHING ELSE IS COMING I MEAN IT'S SO EASY FOR US TO JUST PRODUCE THAT AND IT CAN BE SLIPPED ON
WHICH IS ANOTHER BEAUTY OF IT
MM
LIKE A PUFFER FISH YOU COULD JUST YOU COULD TAKE IT WHEREVER SO I THINK THAT'S QUITE A FLEXIBLE THING
AND ONES THA ONES THAT HAVE RUBBERY SPIKES Y YOU KNOW YOU COULD JUST GO SO FAR WITH IT
RIGHT
YOU CAN YOU CAN JUST
ACUPRESSURE YOU COULD TALK OF ACUPRESSURES
YEAH
YEAH
AND FINALLY THE BODY SHOULD BE RETOUCHABLE MAY MAYBE CH YOU CAN CHANGE THE BODY OR THE CASE CASING THE CASE OUTSIDE
IT SHOULD BE MOULDED IT WITH THE DESIGN IN SUCH A WAY YOU CAN CHANGE IT EVERY TIME
YES
YEAH YEAH J WITH THESE RUBBER THESE RUBBERISED CA NOT THE ACTUAL UH PLASTIC OUTSIDE CASE JUST THE RUBBER THING THAT GOES ROUND THE OUTSIDE
MM
THE RUBBER
OKAY
YEAH
OKAY WE'VE GOT FIVE MINUTES UM OR THAT MIGHT'VE BEEN UP FOR A WHILE
MM SO CAN I JUST RECAP UH SARAH FOR THE DECISIONS THAT WE'VE MADE KINETIC CHARGING THE WATCH TYPE BATTERIES
THAT'S HOW FAR WE'VE GOT WHAT ELSE DO WE HAVE TO ADD TO OUR DECISIONS HERE
RUBBERISED BUTTONS ON THE BOTTOM SIDE WE'RE GONNA USE FRUIT AND VEGETABLE COLOURS FOR THE RUBBER COVER THE CASE ITSELF IS PLASTIC
UM L. C. D. DISPLAY ON TH THE TOP SIDE OF THE FLIP TOP
FINE
YEAH
FINE UH WE WERE TALKING OF VOICE RECOGNITION ALSO BECAUSE THAT WE ARE NOT FOR HOW TO LOOK IT UH REMOTE CONTROL IF IT'S LOST
MM
MM-HMM
SO ARE WE LOOKING AT VOICE
BUT IT'S A GOOD IDEA WE JUST NEED TO CHECK ON THE COST IS THAT RIGHT
YES IT WAS JUST THERE WAS JUST A COST ISSUE WITH THAT
OR MAYBE LIKE UH WILLIAM WAS SUGGESTING IN THE LAST THING SOME DEVICES YOU PUT ON KEY CHAINS
SO WE CAN IF FINANCIALLY VOICE RECOGNITION IS NOT FEASIBLE WE COULD GO FOR A WHISTLE
FOR L YEAH THE WHISTLE
OH YEAH YEAH THE WHISTLE ONES YEAH
AND INCORPORATING THE COMPANY LOGO
YEP
HAVE YOU
UH SORRY I DIDN'T MENTION THIS BUT WE'LL BE INCORPORATING IN THE DESIGN
IT'S NOT JUST A CASE OF HAVING A LITTLE R. R. HIDDEN SOMEWHERE THEY DO WANT IT TO BE OBVIOUS THAT IT'S OUR PRODUCT DON'T THEY
MM
'CAUSE I TOOK IT FROM THE FEEDBACK YOU GAVE IN THE LAST MEETING FROM Y FROM Y YOUR REPORT
OKAY
WELL THEY DO BUT I THINK WE CAN YOU COULD WELL IT IS IT IS I THINK YOU JUST ADDRESS THAT WITH UM ADVERTISING
THE POINT IS THAT IT'S GOT TO STAND OUT SOMEHOW DIFFERENTLY BUT I THINK IT DOES WITHOUT THAT SO I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT THAT
UM YOU ASSOCIATE THE NAME WITH THE INDIVIDUAL PRODUCT THAT IT IS AND THAT DOES THE WORK FOR YOU
OBVIOUSLY IT'LL HAVE A LOGO ON IT JUST LIKE EVERYTHING BUT EVERYTHING ELSE HAS A LOGO ON IT
SINCE IT'S THE ONLY ONE OF ITS KIND ON THE MARKET IT'S OBVIOUSLY GONNA BE OURS
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
I THINK THAT WAS YOU TALKED ABOUT A BEEPER FOR A LOCATION HAVE WE JUST REJECTED THAT IN FAVOUR OF VOICE RECOGNITION THEN
DID WE I KNOW AT THE LAST MEETING WE SPOKE ABOUT A BEEPER
DEPENDING ON HOW I I MEAN WE'VE GOT THIS MEMO SAYING THAT IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE COMPANY'S LOOKING INTO SO
YEAH DEPENDING ON THE EXPENSE OF IT
AND THEY'VE GOT IN STOCK SO YEAH
UM THAT SEEMS TO MAKE SENSE BUT IF IT TURNS OUT THAT IT'S HUGELY EXPENSIVE WE'D HAVE TO CUT DOWN SOMEWHERE ELSE THEN IT'S WORTH THINKING ABOUT
BUT I THINK WE'LL FIND OUT MORE ABOUT COST AFTERWARDS
RIGHT I'M GOING TO WRAP IT UP THERE
YEAH
OKAY
FINE
UM
I GOT A END MEETING NOW MESSAGE ON MY MO YEAH SO
MM-HMM
DID IT
YEAH
AGAIN A QUESTIONNAIRE HUH
SO I THINK WE'VE PROBABLY GOT IT SAYS CLOSING WE HAVE FORTY MINUTES SO I UM THINK WE'VE PROBABLY GOT ABOUT THAT TIME BEFORE WE COME BACK
YOU GOT TO GO THROUGH
IT'S EITHER THAT OR
WE ONLY HAD FORTY MINUTES TO DISCUSS WHAT WE JUST DISCUSSED AND DON'T KNOW HOW LONG THAT TOOK
I THINK WE ARE PRETTY GOING IN A CLEAR DIRECTION NOW
IS EVERYONE HAPPY
OKAY
IF YOU LEAVE THEM ON THE WHOLE TIME YOU GET TO LOOK LIKE A NOODLE THE WHOLE TIME
HMM
IS THAT SOMEONE'S
IS THAT
THANK YOU
THREE APPARENTLY
HMM
HMM
OKAY YOU ALL SWITCHED ON
OKAY
YEP ME TOO
I PRESUME WE'RE GOOD TO GO
OKAY UM
MINUTES UM WE DECIDED TO USE A KINETIC CHARGER
MM-HMM
STANDARD CHIP UM 'CAUSE IT CAN COME IN VARIOUS DIFFERENT SIZES IT WASN'T UH
UH GONNA BE A PROBLEM FACTOR
OKAY
THE CASE MATERIAL IS GONNA BE SOFT RUBBERY CHANGEABLE
UM BRIGHT FUNKY DESIGNS INSPIRED BY FRUIT KEEPING WITH THE HIP KIND OF FEEL
UM AND TO TRY AND INCORPORATE VOICE RECOGNITION SOFTWARE INTO OUR DESIGN UNTIL WE CAN FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THE COST OF THINGS LIKE THAT
UM AND THE RUBBER BUTTONS THAT WE'LL USE WILL BE ANTI R. S. I.
WE WANTED A STAND BY FUNCTION
UM BUTTONS WITH A COMBINATION OF L. C. D. AND RUBBER ACCORDING TO THE DESIGN
PROTOTYPE PRESENTATION
IS THAT FOR US
I THINK THAT WOULD BE YOU
YEP
OKAY
ME AND WILLIAM WORKED ON A PROTOTYPE AND I THINK WILLIAM IS GOING TO MAKE A P PRESENTATION ON THAT
YEAH SHALL I SHOW
I'LL SHOW
CAN I JUST NICK YOUR
THOUGH DO YOU DO YOU WANNA DO YOU WANNA SH DO YOU WANNA HOLD IT AND I'LL I'LL SHOW YOU THE PRESENTATION
YEAH
MAKE SURE THE CAMERA'S
I CAN HOLD IT LIKE
YEAH SO
YES YES YOU CAN
WAIT A SECOND I'LL GET IT OUT
WHOA
IT LOOKS
UM
GOING A BIT CRAZY OVER HERE
CRAZY
OKAY
THANK YOU
YOU SHOULD HAVE ONE OF THOSE THINGS AND YOU CAN JUST TAKE IT OFF
TA DA
UM NOT NOW
OH
YEAH
OH WHERE ARE THE HINGES
AND WE'LL FIRST LOOK AT THE EXTERIOR OF WHAT WE'VE UH COME UP WITH OVER THERE
UM
OKAY SO THIS IS OUR LOOK AND FEEL PRESENTATION THE FINAL OUR FINAL PRESENTATION
RIGHT
MM 'KAY
'KAY
EITHER WE'RE THINKING SOME SOMETHING FAIRLY NEUTRAL LIKE A A WHITE OR A LIGHT BLUE OR SOMETHING
BUT WE CAN WE CAN COME UP WITH THAT
UM THE UM WIDE CHOICE OF COLOURS AND SORT OF PATTERNS SO YOU'VE GOT YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF CUSTOMISATION WITH IT
UM IT'S OBVIOUSLY AN A SORT OF CLAM SHELL DESIGN AND UH THE UM THE TOP L. C. D. SCREEN THAT YOU CAN SEE THAT WOULD B WOULD BE SORT OF UM
THIS IS UNDERNEATH THE RUBBERISED THE RUBBERISED UH OUTER CASING UM WHICH THERE'D BE SORT OF A WIDE CHOICE THEY WOULD BE ATTACHED
IT'S GONNA HAVE A A PLASTIC BODY UM WITH A SORT OF STANDARD COLOUR
YOU ABLE TO LOOK
YEP
MM-HMM
OKAY
THINKING ABOUT IT NOW COULD Y COULD ALSO PROBABLY ATTACH TO THE FLIPPING OPEN AND SHUT AS WELL SO THAT YOU COULD PROBABLY GET A BIT OF
IT WOULD BE SORT OF INSET INTO THE INTO THE TOP AND THE BUTTONS AT THE BOTTOM WOULD D SO SO IT'LL FULLY CLOSE FLAT
HOW DO YOU SAY IT'S YEAH YEAH
AND WORKING ON THE INSIDE WE'VE UM ALREADY SAID D DECIDED ON THE KINETIC BATTERIES WHICH ACTUALLY
YEAH YEAH
THE BLACK AND WHITE TOUCH SCREEN WHEREIN PEOPLE CAN
MM
SO IT'S FLUSH
RIGHT
OH RIGHT OKAY YEAH
SO PUT IT IN THE TOP SECTION RATHER THAN THE BOTTOM SECTIONS 'CAUSE IT'S THE TOP PART THAT'S OKAY
YEAH
SO WE PRESUMED THAT THEY'D ALSO BE QUITE CHEAP
YEAH
UM WE DECIDED THAT UM THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM
SO YOU'D HAVE SOMETHING LIKE WHERE YOU'D SHOUT OUT WHERE WHERE IS THE REMOTE AND
IT DID ACTUALLY SAY ON THE EMAIL THAT THEY WERE SORT OF COMING IN AND THEY WERE FAIRLY EASY TO GET A HOLD OF
MM-HMM
IT'LL SHOUT BACK I'M HERE OR SOMETHING
OR SOMETHING
AND THEN YEAH
UM IT WOULD IT WOULD HAVE OBVIOUSLY 'CAUSE IT'S SPLIT OVER TWO TWO DIFFERENT LAYERS
IT WO IT WON'T SHOUT OUT I'M HERE OR SOMETHING
IT'LL JUST SHOUT OUT I'M HERE OR SOMETHING TO SIMILAR EFFECT
AND THE INFRARED
UH YEAH IF IT WAS GOING LIKE I D WELL THA THAT COULD BE SOMETHING FOR NEXT TIME MAYBE
UM THE STANDARD THERE'S BE A STANDARD TRANSMISSION WITH THE T. V. USING USING ALL THE STANDARD CHIPS THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT
YOU CAN HAVE A REMOTE THAT TELLS YOU EXACTLY WHERE IT IS
AND UH BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY ALL T. V. S USE THIS THE SAME INFRARED MEDIUM WE'D JUST BE USING USING THE SAME THING TO TRANSMIT THE DATA
IT WOULD NEED TWO SEPARATE P. C. B. S SO IT WOULD BE JOINED AT THE HINGE THROUGH SOME SORT OF CABLING
I'M UNDER THE SOFA
OKAY
'KAY
AH OKA
OR THAT WOULD BE TOO COMPLICATED
INFRARED
JUST AT THE FRONT OF THE WE HAVEN'T I DON'T THINK WE ACTUALLY PUT IT ON
UM SENDER WOULD BE ON THE ON ONE OF THE BOT THE BOTTOM LAYER
LIKE HERE
YEAH YEAH SOMETHING LIKE THAT
ACTUALLY NO IT WOULD BE IT WOULD HAVE TO BE ON THE ON THE FRONT
OH RIGHT YEAH OKAY YEAH I'VE GOT YOU
OKAY
YEAH HERE
INFRARED COULD BE HERE ALSO
YEAH ON THE FRONT ON THE FRONT SIDE OF THAT YEAH
SO WHEN IT'S EVEN IF IT'S OPEN HERE THE SIGNALS WOULD GO
YEAH
IT'S STILL POINTING YES
THE TOP SCREEN AS WE SAID IS WOULD BE AN INSET UM BLACK AND WHITE L. C. D. S TOUCH SCREEN WHICH YEAH WOULD
AND THEN FINALLY UM ON TO THE INTERFACE
SO WHEN YOU'VE ACTUALLY GOT IT OPEN IT WOULD BE FACING THE T. V.
YEAH THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE
THIS ONE RIGHT HERE
UH HAVE ALL OF ALL OF THE THE AVAILABLE FUNCTIONS FOR FOR THE REMOTE ON IT UH WHEREAS THE BOT THE BOTTOM SCREEN WOULD JUST CONTAIN THE STANDARD BUTTONS
AND NOW WE'VE WE ALSO DECIDED ON THE INSIDE WE COULD POSSIBLY EITHER HAVE UM SOME SOME KIND OF SORT OF BEZZLED
LIKE THE VO VOLUME UP AND DOWN CHANNEL UP AND DOWN POWER ON AND OFF AND UH THINGS TO THAT EFFECT
OKAY
UH LOGO ON IT OR SOMETHING INSET OR MAYBE AN ENGRAVING OF THE LOGO ON THE TOP
WHICH IS
BUT NOT INTERFERING WITH THE OUTSIDE KIND OF LOOK OF THE PRODUCT ONCE IT'S
AND FINALLY THAT'S HOW WE PUT THE FASHION BACK INTO ELECTRONICS AS THAT IS THAT'S THE COMPANY LOGO
NO D NOT NOT ACTUALLY
NO NOT UH INTERFERING WITH L THE WHOLE LOOK OF THE THE PRODUCT WHEN IT'S UH ON THE THING
NO
LOOK UP TO IT
OKAY
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
YAY
WRAPPING IT ALL UP OKAY
UM I'VE NOW GOT EVALUATION CRITERIA
WELL DONE
CERTAINLY
SORRY
SO THIS IS THE ONE
OKAY
IT'S TO BE PRESENTED
THERE YOU GO
OOPS
LOGGED IN
THANK YOU
EVALUATION
MM UM I I THINK THIS IS CHIP
IT'S QUITE SIMILAR TO WHAT IT WAS BEFORE THOUGH
SO THIS IS THE FIRST STAGE OF THE EVALUATION
NOW THE COLLECTION OF THE CRITERIA AS WE SAW IN OUR PREVIOUS MEETING
OKAY
WAS BASED ON THE USER REQUIREMENTS AND TRENDS FOUND IN THE MARKETING REPORTS AND MARKETING STRATEGY OF OUR COMPANY
THIS STAGE OF THE EVALUATION IS REALLY FOR US AS A TEAM TO EVALUATE IF WE HAVE NOW GOT A PRODUCT SPECIFICATION AND PROTOTYPE DESIGN THAT MEETS THE THE CRITERIA THAT WE GOT FROM OUR MARKET RESEARCH
SO IT'S WHAT WE'VE DISCUSSED IN THE LAST MEETING ARE WE ACTUALLY MEETING THOSE TRENDS AND REQUIREMENTS
SORRY
THE CRITERIA THAT WE WANT IN THIS REMOTE CONTROL ARE A FANCY LOOK AND FEEL TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION IT SHOULD BE EASY TO USE
THOUGH THAT DID SEEM TO BE THE FAVOURED STRATEGY BUT THERE WAS ALSO ON THE SIDELINE THE THOUGH OF MAYBE HAVING A BEEPER FUNCTION
IT SHOULD INCORPORATE CURRENT FASHION TRENDS AND THOSE THE TWO MAIN ONES THEY WERE THE SPONGY TEXTURE AND THE FRUIT AND VEGETABLE STRONG DESIGN COLOURS
THE DESIGN SHOULD MINIMISE R. S. I. AND BE EASY TO LOCATE AND WE WERE STILL UM UH SLIGHTLY AMBIVALENT AS TO WHETHER TO USE VOICE RECOGNITION THERE
NOW THE FINDINGS THAT WE CAME UP WITH JUST A RECAP ARE HERE
MM-HMM
ANY QUESTIONS THERE
WE'RE GOING TO USE A SEVEN POINT SCALE WHERE ONE IS TRUE AND SEVEN IS FALSE
OKAY SO WE CAN COME BACK TO THAT SLIDE IF YOU DON'T HAVE A NOTE OF THOSE
I'LL JUST SHOW YOU HOW WE'RE GOING TO EVALUATE OUR OWN FEEDBACK TO THIS TO WHAT WE HAVE SO FAR
AND I WILL JUST DO A PRELIMINARY RATING OF ALL THOSE CRITERIA ON THE WHITEBOARD HERE
WE LOOK AT EACH OF THOSE CRITERIA THAT I'VE JUST MENTIONED I'LL CALL THAT SLIDE BACK UP
DOES THAT SEEM CLEAR
YEAH
MM-HMM
AH IT'S PERFECT
SO WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT THESE CRITE
IS IT EVERYBODY IS GOING TO EVALUATE OR JUST THE MARKET OKAY
IS THAT OKAY
YES WE'RE GOING TO COME TO W WE'LL DISCUSS EACH ONE AND WE'LL COME TO A CONSENSUS RATING BETWEEN ONE AND SEVEN
ONE IS TRUE SEVEN IS FALSE
MM-HMM
OKAY
'KAY
C. D. E. F. TO CONFUSE IT WITH THE NUMBER RATING
THIS IS WHERE I REALISE HOW TINY I ACTUALLY AM
RIGHT
IT WILL JUST BE CRITERIA ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX OR A. B.
B. C. D. E. F.
SO I WON'T WRITE ALL OF THAT OUT AGAIN
JUST WRITE SMALL
CRITERIA
AND RATING
OKAY
SO I'LL JUST SEPARATE THE RATINGS BY OBLIQUES AND IF WE GO ONE TWO THREE FOUR WE KNOW WHO'S WHO
HOW ABOUT THAT
ACTUALLY IT MIGHT BE AN IDEA IF WE EACH DID GIVE OUR OWN INDIVIDUAL RATING AND WE COULD TAKE AN AVERAGE AT THE END
THAT WORKS
YEAH
YEAH SO YOU CAN
YEAH OKAY
YEAH
MM-HMM
CRITERIA A. THE FANCY LOOK AND FEEL
MY OWN RATING FOR THAT WOULD BE A TWO
ONE IS TRUE SEVEN IS FALSE
OKAY
HOW DO WE FEEL ABOUT THIS PROTOTYPE MODEL RELATING TO FANCY IT IS A FANCY LOOK AND FEEL
ONE IS TRUE AND SEVEN IS FALSE
I WOULD AGREE
THREE
NO THREE
YEAH I'D UH YEAH I'D PROBABLY PUT IT UH TWO YEAH TWO OR THREE
I'LL JUST GO THIS WAY
OKAY
'KAY
TWO
OKAY
I WOULD SAY TWO
TWO
I WOULD SAY FOUR
MM-HMM
ADDING THOSE UP WE'VE GOT A SIX AND A FIVE ELEVEN DIVIDED BY FOUR IS WHAT
UH TWO AND THREE QUARTERS IT THAT RIGHT
A FOUR OKAY
TWO AND THREE QUARTERS
MM YEAH
ALMOST THREE
I THINK YEAH
YEAH YEAH
OKAY
OKAY CRITERIA B. CRITERION B. TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE
TWO POINT SEVEN FIVE THERE WE GO
I WOULD GIVE THAT A THREE
I'D GIVE IT A ONE
OKAY
NOT THAT YOU'RE BIASED IN THAT IT THE DESIGNER
NO NO NOT AT ALL
A TWO
CAN YOU JUST MAKE IT TWO
THE FIRST ONE RATING I'M SORRY
OH SORRY I I GOT IT WRONG
THE AVERAGE OH FOR YOU
YOU WANT YOUR RATING TO BE A TWO
YEAH I I JUST IT THE OTHER WAY
THE FIRST
UH IN
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
OKAY
YEP I JUST GOT
IT'S A VERY SLIGHTLY ALTERED
SO I'LL WORK OUT THE AVERAGE FOR THAT AGAIN AT THE END
OKAY AND WE'RE JUST WAITING FOR YOUR RATING F
TWO POINT F
IT'S JUST TWO POINT FIVE FOR THAT ONE
TWO POINT FIVE OKAY
YEAH
LOSING ONE DECIMAL PLACE THAT'S OKAY
ONE IS A SEVEN IS FALSE OKAY
SO WHAT ARE YOU RATING FOR THIS ONE PAW
TWO OKAY
TWO
THAT BRINGS IT DOWN TO TWO NICE AND SIMPLE YEAH
SO THAT IS EIGHT
TWO
OKAY EASE OF USE
EASY TO USE
BASED ON WHAT YOU'VE SAID THERE I WOULD SAY A ONE TRUE
TWO
TWO
I WOULD SAY A TWO
I WOULD SAY A TWO
A TWO OKAY
TWO
TWO
UM MM NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT IT INCORPORATES CURRENT FASHION TRENDS
WE'LL JUST PUT ALMOST TWO BECAUSE I'M NOT GONNA GET INTO SILLY DECIMAL PLACES
OR WE OR IF WE WANT TO REALLY BRING IT DOWN WE CAN DO LATER
I SHOULD'VE SAID A TWO TO MAKE THE ARITHMETIC EASY SHOULDN'T I
NOW THAT'S PARTICULARLY IN RELATION TO OUR MARKET RESEARCH FINDINGS ABOUT THE SPONGY TEXTURE TO THE EXTERIOR AND THE FRUIT AND VEGETABLE DESIGN COLOURS
OKAY
OKAY MM-HMM
ONE POINT SEVEN F FIVE
YEAH
D.
ONE
YEAH
IS THIS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE THE COLOURS THAT YOU WOULD USE
SO I'M JUST THINKING BEFORE I GIVE IT MY RATING YOU WERE LIMITED IN THE USE OF MATERIALS FOR YOUR PROTOTYPE HERE
RIGHT
YEAH THAT'S
NO NO THE THE BASE COLOUR WAS UM WHITE OR OR LIKE OR L SORT OF A LIGHT BLUE
BUT THE CHANGEABLE FA FACES WOULD UH ALLOW YOU TO GET ANY BASICALLY ANY ONE OF A NUMBER OF COLOURS THAT UH TH IT'S FULL SORT OF CUSTOMISED
UH BLUE
WITH FOR THE PLASTIC
WHITE
RIGHT
ANY
OKAY
SO WE COULD USE ANY STRONG FRUIT AND VEG COLOURS AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE INTENDING TO DO
AND THE SPONGY FEEL IS NO PROBLEM WITH THAT
RIGHT
YEAH YEAH YEAH AND
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
NO NO 'CAUSE TH THAT'S THAT'S THE THE SPONGY FEEL WOULD BE IN THE RUBBER THAT YOU PUT ROUND IT
THAT OTHERWISE IT'S JUST SORT OF HARD PLASTIC
YEAH BECAUSE YOU'LL BE HAVING A
BECAUSE OF THE RUBBER CASE
OKAY
IN THAT CASE IT'S GOT TO BE A ONE FOR ME
YEAH I'LL GIVE IT A ONE AS WELL
YEP
OKAY
EVERYBODY
ONE
ONE
THAT PART WAS NICE AND EASY
UH MOVING ON TO DOES THE DESIGN MINIMISE REPETITIVE STRAIN INJURY
OKAY
YEAH
MM
I DON'T THINK WE'VE REALLY TOUCHED ON THAT A LOT
WE'VE WE'VE DISCUSSED IT WE HAVEN'T REALLY COME UP WITH ANYTHING THAT
MM
NO
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT POINTERS BUT THE VERY USE OF A REMOTE CONTROL IF YOU'RE SOMEONE WHO'S ZAPPING
WHO'S SITTING LIKE THAT AND WE FOUND SO MANY PEOPLE DID HOW DO YOU MINIMISE THAT ON SUCH A SMALL DEVICE
WE FELT COULD FEASIBLY REDUCE THAT
YEAH
UM
WELL THE TYPE OF BUTTON THAT WE'RE GONNA USE IN THE BOTTOM HALF THE MATERIAL MINIMISES R. S. I. IT'S MEANT TO
IT'S MEANT TO BE
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
SO MAYBE BECAUSE THERE'S MORE SPACE IT'S NOT KIND OF MOVING AROUND TRYING TO
MAYBE BECAUSE IT'S SLIGHTL WITH THE SIZE THAT WE'VE GOT IT'S QUITE SMALL BUT WITH THE AMOUNT OF STUFF WE'RE PUTTING ON IT ISN'T THAT MUCH
MM
MM-HMM
HIT ACCURATELY THE BUTTONS IN BETWEEN
UM
IT'S QUITE OBVIOUS JUST BIG BUTTONS
RIGHT
I THINK I'M GONNA HAVE TO BE NEUTRAL ON THAT AND GIVE IT A FOUR
RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH I'D UH I'D F I'D GO FOR A FIVE ACTUALLY 'CAUSE
A FIVE OKAY
FOUR
FOUR AND A FOUR OKAY
FOUR
TWENTY ONE IS THAT TWENTY ONE
SO THAT'S FOUR POINT TWO FIVE
YEP
NOW WE TALKED ABOUT VOICE RECOGNITION WE TALKED ABOUT A BEEPER HAVE WE REALLY HAVE THE DESIGNERS COME TO ANY DEC REAL DECISION ON THAT
AND FINALLY LAST BUT NOT LEAST EASY TO LOCATE
YEAH
YEAH IT WAS IT WAS UH A VOICE VOICE RECOGNITION YEAH
VOICE R RECOGNITION
IT WAS THE I'M HERE THING YEP
AND ARE WE HAPPY WITH THE COSTS ON THAT
THAT IS GOING TO BE FEASIBLE COST WISE
YEAH YEAH THAT YEAH THAT'S FEASIBLE
THAT SOUNDS GOOD THEN
I'D GO FOR A I CA WE CAN ADJUST THE VOLUME ON THAT JUST AS WE COULD VOLUME ON T. V.
UM I THINK IT WOULD R
SO IF SOMBODY'S IN THE OTHER ROOM OR IF T. V. S IN DIFFERENT ROOMS OR
I THINK IT WOULD PROBABLY BE A A STAND IT WOULD BE A STAND IT WOULD BE QUITE LOUD
SO IT WOULD BE S P YEAH
A STANDARD
IT WOULD BE
RIGHT
OKAY
YOU BUILT INTO THE FEATURE
AND IF YOU DIDN'T HEAR IT IN THE ROOM THAT YOU WERE STANDING IN THEN YOU'D REALISE THAT IT WASN'T IN THAT ROOM YOU'D GO INTO ANOTHER ROOM
OKAY
YEAH
THAT'S A ONE FOR ME
LOGICAL
YEAH ONE
ONE AND ONE GOOD
ONE
I DO REALISE THAT WE MIGHT BE BEING FAIRLY BIASED 'CAUSE IT IS OUR PRODUCT BUT
WE'VE GOT OUR OUR WE'VE GOT THE HIGHEST RATING OF MEETING THE SPECIFICATIONS THAT IS DEFINITELY TRUE FOR TWO OF THE UH SIX CRITERIA THERE
THAT IS FOR UM INCORPORATES CURRENT FASHION TRENDS AND IS EASY TO LOCATE
OR DO WE HAVE TO MAKE FURTHER MODIFICATIONS
THE LOWEST RATING WE'VE GOT WHICH IS REALLY N IT'S NOT TERRIBLY LOW I IT'S CLOSE AROUND NEUTRAL IS FOR UH THE MINIMISATION OF REPETITIVE STRAIN INJURY
DO WE FEEL ON THE BASIS OF THA OF THESE EVALUATION FINDINGS THAT WE CAN GO AHEAD AND NOW PRODUCE THIS AS A PROTOTYPE AND MARKET IT
SO HOW DO WE FEEL ABOUT THIS
I DON'T THINK SO
W I THIN YEAH I THINK YEAH
WE HAPPY TO GO AHEAD
I THINK WE'RE SET
I THINK WE YEAH
AND I REALLY DOUBT IF
YEAH
I THINK FOR MOST OF THOSE RATINGS THAT IT'S HIGH ENOUGH AT THE UPPER END OF THE SCALE FOR US TO GO AHEAD WITH THAT
ON THE BASIS OF CURRENT TECHNOLOGY AND OUR CURRENT CAPABILITIES WE COULD ACTUALLY DO MUCH MORE TO MINIMISE THAT
DO MUCH APART FROM HAVING A HUGE BIG
MM
OKAY
WELL I HOPE THAT'S UH CLEAR TO THE TEAM
IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WOULD LIKE TO TO ASK ME ABOUT THE FINDINGS BEFORE I
I KNOW
SUM UP
DON'T THINK SO
NO
I'LL JUST LEAVE IT THERE
OOPS
GOOD
FINE THEN
OKAY THANK YOU
OKAY I'VE GOT FINANCE HERE NOW
I'M GONNA PLUG THIS IN SO YOU CAN ALL SEE IT IF THAT'S OKAY
HMM
UM
OH YES
YOU WANT ME TO B UNPLUG THAT
YES
THAT'S ALL
THANKS
RIGHT
OKAY
NOW I PRESUME
THAT THE SCREEN WILL GO BLANK
THAT UM
WE JUST TYPE NUMBERS INTO THIS AND WE COME OUT WITH THE FINAL VALUE
OKAY
SO ARE WE STILL ON FOR KINETIC
YEAH
YES
SEE IT WOULDA BEEN HANDY TO HAVE THIS AT THE BEGINNING
UM IT MIGHT HAVE INFLUENCED OUR CHOICE
OKAY
RIGHT WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE ELECTRONICS
IT WAS A REGULAR CHIP ON PRINT AND
CHIP ON PRINT
DOUBLE CURVED
OH NO NO NO THE UM
YEAH IT'S YOU YOU'VE PUT IN THREE FOR THE NUMBER OF KINETIC CELLS THERE SHOULD JUST BE ONE
IN THE TOP IT'S THE NUMBER OF C YEAH
OH RIGHT OKAY
THANKS
YEAH AND YEAH JUST A NO ONE REG V UH
SO WOULD THERE BE TWO
ONE CHIP
YEAH ONE OF THEM AND ONE SAMPLE SENSOR AND SAMPLE SPEAKER
OKAY
OKAY
YEP
AND THEY'RE DOUBLE CURVED
Y
NO
SINGLE CURVED
ONE DOUBLE CURVE
TWO 'CAUSE IT'S TWO
TWO CURVES YEAH
SO IT CAN REST
BUT IT HAS A SLIGHTLY FLATTENED BOTTOM SO IT CAN SIT
SO WHAT'S A SINGLE CURVE THEN
YEAH I'D SAY I'D SAY IT WAS W YEAH I THINK I THINK IT'S
IT WOULD JUST BE A FLAT BOTTOM WITH ONE CURVE
LIKE A DOMED THING
SO JUST ONE DOUBLE
SINGLE CU
MM
ONE DOUBLE CURVED
YEAH
UM
AND ONE NO 'CAUSE ONE YEAH ONE'S DOUBLE CURVED AND THEN THE OTHER ONE'S
PLASTIC AND RUBBER
THE OTHER CURVES AT THE SIDES BUT IT'S SLIGHTLY FLATTENED AT THE BOTTOM SO IT DOESN'T ROLL OVER
YEAH
MM
UM WE'VE GOT PLASTIC AND RUBBER HAVEN'T WE
A PLASTIC
YEAH
YEAH
PLASTIC ONE AND MAYBE RUBBER POINT FIVE
AND SPECIAL COLOUR
NO I THINK RUBBER SINCE IT'S BEING USED JUST AS A CASING WE CAN PUT POINT FIVE
UM
YEAH
DO YOU THINK
YEAH BECAUSE THERE ARE
I THINK IT ALLOWS THE POINT FIVE YEAH
WE CAN USE THAT
YEAH
OKAY
WHAT DOES IT MEAN IF YOU PUT POINT FIVE FOR THAT
IT MEANS WE ARE NOT USING A LOT OF RUBBER ACTUALLY
WE'RE USING JUST
IT WOULD BE LIKE SAYING WE'RE USING
A VERY LOW QUANTITY OF RUBBER COMPARED TO PLASTIC
SEE IT SAYS CASE MATERIAL
MM-HMM
SO WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY USING PLASTIC IN THE CASE ARE WE
IT'S INCLUDING IT'S INCLUDING
NO NO THAT'S IT'S AS AN EXTRA
RIGHT OKAY
SO THAT SHOULDN'T THAT SHOULDN'T BE ACTUALLY ON THERE BECAUSE THAT'S NOT INCORPORATED IN THE COST OF THE REMOTE YOU GET
THERE'S NOWHERE ELSE WE CAN CODE FOR THE THE RUBBER USED IN THE CASING
BUT IT IS GONNA BE PART OF THE TOTAL COST AND THERE'S NOWHERE ELSE WE CAN WE CAN PUT THAT IN IS THERE
SO DO WE NOT HAVE TO ACCOUNT FOR IT IN THE COST SOMEWHERE THERE
OKAY WE'LL JUST PUT IT IN AS WE'LL PUT IN AS HALF
OKAY
OR SH WE SHOULD JUST PUT IT IN AS ONE BECAUSE THE PLASTIC IS ZERO ANYWAY
YEAH OKAY
MM
OKAY SPECIAL COLOUR DO WE NEED THAT
NO WE DON'T STEP ON ANYONE'S TOES
MIGHT DO IF WE GO FOR SOME OF THE MORE EXOTIC AUBERGINES AND SUCH LIKE COLOURS
N YEAH OKAY
INTERFACE
PUSH BUTTON
YEAH THE PUSH BUTTON'S ONE AND L. C. DISPLAY ONE
ONE
AN
ONE
AND BUTTONS
BUTTONS
S
INSTEAD OF GOING FOR KINETIC HOW ABOUT GOING FOR A STANDARD BATTERY
I THINK WE COULD CHANGE THE BATTERY ALSO
IS IT OH IT'S BROUGHT IT SLIGHTLY DOWN
HAS THAT NOT MADE ANY D IF YOU CLICK OFF THAT SQUARE NOW HAS THAT NOT MADE ANY DIFFERENCE
WELL YES
HAS THAT NOT GONE UP
OH NO IT WAS SEVEN FIVE IT'S CHANGED NOT A LOT
SO IS IS UNCURVED COMPLETELY AND JUST ACTUALLY MAKING THE RUBBER CASE THE CURVED THING IS THAT GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE
YEAH
UNCURVED FLAT
OH IT'S NOT MADE ANY DIFFERENCE HAS IT
NO WE'LL HAVE
NO IT JUST SURPRISES ONE
OH IT'S NOT CALCULATED IT
NO NO YOU'VE GOT TO CLICK OFF TO CALCULATE IT AGAIN
OH
OKAY THERE WE GO
IT'S BROUGHT IT DOWN SLIGHTLY
IT'S NOT A LOT THOUGH
IT COULD BE IN DOLLARS
C IT MIGHT UH YOU MIGHT YOU MIGHT BE ASSUMING THAT THAT IS IN EUROS
AND THEN IT WOULD BE FINE BECAUSE THE EXCHANGE RANGE WOULD MAKE IT ABOUT TWELVE
NO
I DON'T THINK SO
IS THERE ANYTHING ON THE MENU
WE HAVEN'T BEEN DEALIN WE HAVEN'T BEEN DEALING WITH DOLLARS THOUGH I THINK
NO
RI I THINK IT'S IN EURO
OKAY SO THE HIGHEST WE'VE GOT IS THE ELECTRONICS HERE
UM
AND THE INTERFACE
IF WE TR UM
IF WE MOVED AWAY FROM OUR MUCH LOVED IDEA OF A KINETIC BATTERY AND JUST WENT WITH THE STANDARD BATTERIES WOULD THAT MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE
AND GOING TO A REGULAR BAT
THE BIGGEST ONE WOULD BE TAKING AWAY IF YOU TOOK AWAY
YEAH THE STANDARD IT UM IT WOULD MAKE ONE DIFFERENCE
YEAH
BUT SHAPE AND COLOURS THAT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULDN'T COMPRIMI
WHAT I FEEL IS CUSTOMERS NEVER SAID ANYTHING ABOUT THE BATTERY
IT'S INTERNAL NOBODY LOOKS INTO THE BATTERY
IF YOU TO
YEAH
AND PEOPLE ARE USED TO BUYING BATTERIES THEY'RE NOT GONNA SAY I'M NOT GETTING THIS 'CAUSE I'VE GOT TO BUY A BATTERY FOR A REMOTE CONTROL
BUT IF YOU TAKE AWAY THE VOICE RECOGNITION THEN YOU'VE GOT IT
IF IF YOU TAKE AWAY THE VOICE I I DO I DON'T LIKE TO SAY IT
WHERE'S THAT SPECIAL FORM
MM MM MM
SHOULD WE SEE WHAT DIFFERENCE IT MAKES
WHERE'S THE
NO 'CAUSE IT'S SAMPLES SENS SAMPLE SPEAKER
IF YOU TOOK AWAY THAT THAT'LL MAKE IT TWELVE POINT THREE FIVE
YEAH I YEAH
WHERE'S THE VOICE RECOGNITION
UM
RIGHT OKAY
WELL THE KINETIC IS THREE
IF WE CHANGE IT TO THE BATTERY IT'S THAT'S MINUS THREE
THEY N N YEAH BUT YOU P MINUS THREE PLUS TWO
I KEEP SEEING ZERO
OH RIGHT
UM
WE COULD DO THE VOICE RECOGNITION FOR YOU KNOW BUSINESS CLASS OR SOMETHING YOU KNOW LIKE AN UPGRADED VERSION
YOU COULD CHOOSE TO HAVE THAT OR NOT
WE CAN DO IT SOME OTHER WAY WE CAN DO IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE VOICE RECOGNITION
YEAH
BUT THEY BUT I MEAN IN I DON'T SEE WHY WE HAVE TO SELL IT FOR TWENTY FIVE EUROS NOW
YEAH
BECAUSE THEY W THEY WERE SAYING THEY WERE QUITE WILLING TO PAY MORE FOR BETTER PRODUCT
SURE
MM-HMM
BUT WE'RE STILL WORKING TO UM HEAD O
SO SHOULD WE JUST CHANGE THE DESIGN SPECIFICATION THEN
MAKE IT COSTLY
WE CAN PUT IN OUR RECOMMENDATIONS
BUT WE NEED TO WORK TO THAT SPECIFICATION TO START WITH
WE CAN PUT IN OUR RECOMMENDATIONS FOR WHAT WE'VE WE'VE FOUND AND WHAT WE THE CONSENSUS THAT WE'VE COME TO AS A RESULT OF THE MEETINGS
AND I THINK THE VOICE RECOGNITION SOUNDS WONDERFUL
IF WE IF WE'RE WORKING TO HEAD OFFICE SPECIFICATIONS AS THIS IS WHAT THIS PROJECT TEAM'S WORKING FOR
BUT OUR OBJECT IS SO DISTINCTIVE THAT THAT IN ITSELF IS GONNA MAKE IT EASIER TO LOCATE AS A F YOU KNOW IN A FIRST INSTANCE
UM AS YOU SAY WE CAN OFFER THE VOICE RECOGNITION INITIALLY TO BUSINESS CLASS CUSTOMERS AND SO
YES
YEAH
MM-HMM
WE C WE COULD S
YEAH WE COULD SAY
MM-HMM
OKAY WE CAN
YEAH I S
THEY LIKE THEIR GADGETS THEY LIKE SOMETHING THAT'S COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
MAKE THE PRICE FIT AND THEN SAY IF WE'D HAD OUR BUDGET WE WOULD'VE HAD THIS BECAUSE IT ALSO SETS IT APART FROM THE CROWD
RIGHT OKAY SO
IT'S S SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR COMPANY
AND THEN SAY WE RECOMMEND
MM
YEAH
YEAH
'CAUSE WE'VE DONE ALL THE BACKGROUND WORK TO GO FOR THAT IF THEY WANT IT
YEAH
YEAH
SO IF WE TAKE VOICE RECOGNITION OUT
THAT'LL DO IT
IS IT TWELVE POINT FIF WAS IT TWELVE POINT FIFTY
TWELVE POINT THREE FIVE
YEAH WE ARE CLOSE TO THE BUDGET
WE ARE
TWO FIVE
IT'S TWO POINT FIVE
NO IT'S TWELVE POINT TWO FIVE
ARE YOU SURE
SORRY NOT MEANING TO DOUBT YOUR WORDS THERE
YEAH WELL TWO TWELVE POINT TWO FIVE TIMES TWO IS
ARE THEY REALLY GOING TO QUIBBLE ABOUT TEN P.
RIGHT
TWENTY FIVE ISN'T IT
IT'S TWELVE POINT FIVE MAYBE THEN
WHICH IS LESS THAN TEN P.
OR POINT ZERO ONE OF A EURO
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT SAID FIFTY PERCENT OF THE COST
SO HALF OF THE PRICE WOULD BE
NO
I THINK THE AGENDA ONE WAS WHERE THE UM PRICE WAS WASN'T IT
I THINK IT IS THE FIRST ONE
THAT'S TODAY'S
KICK OFF MEETING
TWELVE POINT FIVE
MM
I THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT IT WAS
AH
SO WE ARE UNDER THE BUDGET
WELL DONE PEOPLE
SO WE'RE OKAY
OKAY
SO IS THAT UH GOT US COVERED FOR THE ELECTRONICS THEN
OKAY
WE DON'T NEED SOMETHING ELSE TO TAKE THAT PLACE
YEAH
'CAUSE THAT THAT WAS JUST A BOUGHT ON EXTRA YOU COULD JUST TAKE THAT OUT
NO
AND THAT WOULD BE FINE YEAH
OKAY
SEEMS FINE
YEAH I THINK THAT'S BRILLIANT
EXCEPT VOICE RECOGNITION EVERYTHING IS
RIGHT SO WE'VE DONE THAT
OKAY
PRODUCT EVALUATION
UM
WE'VE DONE ROOM FOR CREATIVITY HAVEN'T WE
BECAUSE WE'VE GOT DECISIONS THAT WE WOULD HAVE MADE THAT WE WEREN'T DIDN'T FEEL ABLE TO MAKE
YEAH
YEAH
I PRESUME WE DISCUSSED LEADERSHIP AND TEAMWORK
MM-HMM
YES
YEAH
UM IN THE SENSE THAT
UM DID YOU FEEL LIKE A TEAM
OR DID YOU FEEL LIKE UH AUTONOMY
YEAH I'D SAY AS A TEAM
ALTHOUGH WE HAD OUR SEPARATE TASKS THERE WAS SO MUCH INTERACTION SO MUCH THAT WE NEEDED TO UM BOUNCE OFF EACH OTHER
AND I'VE CERTAINLY FELT HEARD LISTENED TO IN THAT IN RELEVANT AREAS WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO YOU KNOW GIVE AND TAKE AND ADJUST OUR REMIT WHERE NECESSARY
I THINK WE HAD A NICE TIME
YEAH
FIND OUT FROM EACH OTHER YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
IT'S NOT LIKE PEOPLE TRYING TO CUT EACH OTHER
WE CAME TO A VERY PREDIC CREATIVE DESIGN YEAH
YEAH I THINK THERE WAS UH VERY CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK BY EVERYBODY
THERE IS MORE OF UH TRUE COHESIVE TEAMWORK
YEAH AND UH
AND SARAH YOU COORDINATED THE WORK VERY WELL
YEAH I THINK
THANK YOU
HOW DID YOU FIND IT
YEAH NO I THOUGHT IT IT WENT REALLY WELL AND I YEAH
ALTHOUGH WE DIDN'T QUITE MAKE THE VOICE RECOGNITION IN THERE BUT THAT'S THAT'S GOOD
I THINK MAYBE IT WOULD'VE COME OUT A D LITTLE DIFFERENT BUT YEAH
I I FEEL THAT EVERYONE WAS LISTENED TO AND ALL THE POINTS THAT WERE RAISED SEEM TO HAVE BEEN SORTED OUT
I THINK IT WOULD HAVE MADE IT INTO THE FINAL PRODUCT IF IT WAS ACTUALLY IF IF IF WE'D SEEN THE MARKETING BEFORE THE INITIAL SPECIFICATION WAS PUT OUT
YEAH
I LIKE THAT
YEAH
I LIKED THE FACT THAT WE COULD SAY AN IDEA AND IT'D BE SUGGESTED THAT THAT WASN'T THE BEST IDEA BUT NO ONE FELT LIKE SHOT DOWN
UM
YOU KNOW Y IT DIDN'T MATTER IT SAYING WHAT YOU THOUGHT BECAUSE IF IT WASN'T SOMETHING THAT WAS THAT RELEVANT
THEN IT DIDN'T MATTER 'CAUSE IT WAS JUST ANOTHER IDEA IN THE FIELD
YEAH
YEAH
MM
YEAH
TEAMWORK
WELL YOU TWO CREATED THAT WONDERFUL SPECIMEN OF A PLAY DOH MODEL
YEAH WELL
I THINK THAT WAS THE BEST PART OF THE
UM
UM UH I'M STILL NOT CAUGHT UP
BUT THAT'S NOTHING TO DO WITH THE TEAMWORK AT ALL
AND FAKE R. C. S
MAYBE WE SHOULD THINK OF BRANCHING OUT INTO CHILDREN'S TOYS AND FAKE MOBILE PHONES AS A SIDE LINE
MAYBE
'KAY
UM MEANS WHITEBOARD DIGITAL PENS ETCETERA WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
NO THAT WAS QUITE FUN
ANY IDEAS
DISCUSS WHICH ONES YEAH
HOW DO WE EVALUATE THE MATERIALS WE HAD FOR COMMUNICATING AND SHARING INFORMATION
YEAH
COULD IT'VE BEEN BETTER WAS IT ADEQUATE
YEAH I THINK I THINK WE PROBABLY WOULDA USED THE OUTER EMAIL SYSTEM MORE HAD WE ACTUALLY
HAD TIME TO KIND OF
MM
HAD HAD MORE TIME AND IF WE'D BEEN SEPARATED MORE
RATHER THAN HAVING TO EMAIL IT YEAH
BUT IT WAS NICE HAVING IT THERE
YEAH 'CAUSE WE COULD JUST SORT OF SAY SORRY WHAT DID YOU SAY ABOUT THAT OR WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
UM LIKE THE WHOLE PICTURE OF THE THING
YEAH MOVING AROUND THE ROOM
BUT I THINK IT'S GOOD LIKE UH WE SPENT TIMES INDIVIDUALLY
YEAH
I NEVER THOUGHT OF A REMOTE CONTROL WITH A FLIP TOP
YEAH I THINK IT'S NEW IDEAS IN GENERAL RATHER THAN
IT'S REALLY BORROWING FROM OTHER AREAS IT'S YOU KNOW BRINGING THINGS FROM OTHER AREAS IN
IT SO IT'S I MEAN NOTHING IS NEW BUT IT'S APPLYING IT TO A D IN A DIFFERENT AREA
YEAH
MM
VEGETABLES
THAT'S MINE
YEAH
WELL THEY HAVE TO COME FROM SOMEWHERE DON'T THEY
YEAH NO
YEAH IT'S
ABSOLUTELY YEAH
THE THING IS
AND AS SH AS W SORRY YOU GO
I MEAN THEY'RE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT SO IF SOMEONE'S BEEN SHUT IN THE ROOM AND SAID MAKE OURS A BIT DIFFERENT FROM EVERYONE ELSE'S
UM AS WAS SHOWN BY YOUR PRESENTATION WITH ALL OF THE OTHER CONTROLS REMOTE CONTROLS NO ONE'S THOUGHT ABOUT IT PARTICULARLY
'CAUSE IT'S W SOMETHING WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT BUT OBVIOUSLY NO ONE'S PUT ANY GREAT DEAL OF THOUGHT INTO IT
YEP SORRY GO ON SARAH
NO
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
UH D THEY DON'T REALLY THINK ABOUT IT BECAUSE NORMALLY THE REMOTE CONTROL ISN'T THE PRODUCT WHICH THEY'RE TRYING TO SHIP
YEAH JUST JAZZ IT UP A BIT
THEY'RE JUST LIKE WE'VE GOT A D. V. D. PLAYER DOES ANYONE REMEMBER THE REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH I DO I DON'T THINK THE THE COMPANIES ARE REALLY CONCERNED
THEY'RE TRYING TO SHIP THE D. V. D. PLAYER THE VIDEO PLAYER THE T. V.
CAN'T YOU GET THE ONE THAT WE USED FOR THE LAST ONE
YEAH
MM
YEAH
YEAH THE FOCUS ISN'T ON TO THAT YEAH
BUT PEOPLE COULD HAVE ANYTHING THAT THEY WANTED
I MEAN IF YOU COULD HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S A PROPER FUNKY THING A FUNKY ITEM THAT'S INDIVIDUAL INDIVIDUAL TO YOU
BUT THEN WHEN IT EVERYTHING IS REALLY SMART AND YOU'VE JUST GOT THIS BIG CHUNK OF BLACK THING SITTING ON YOUR COFFEE TABLE IT DOESN'T GO
I MEAN THEY COULD EVEN GO INTO UM YOU GO IN WITH AN IDEA AND THEY DESIGN IT ON PHOTOSHOP AND THEN THEY JUST GET IT PRINTED ON THE PLASTIC
YOU WOULD PRAY YOU WOULD PAY A LOT EXTRA BECAUSE IT'S INDIVIDUALLY BEING A PLASTIC WAS BEING MADE FOR YOU
YEAH
YEAH
NO
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
MM
SURPRISING TO ME IS LIKE UH PEOPLE GIVE A LOT OF ATTENTION TO MODIFYING MOBILE PHONES LIKE A REAL WANT TO SEE A NEW LAUNCH OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
AND NEW F TELEVISION PRODUCTS COMING UP BUT NOBODY GIVING UH MUCH IDEA TO THIS
LIKE SARAH WAS TELLING EVERYTHING'S
BECAUSE OF THE PRODU
MM
YEAH
I MEAN THIS IS THE FIRST CHANGE IN REMOTE CONTROL DEVICES THAT I CAN REALLY YOU KNOW SAY IS IS OBVIOUS AND VISIBLE
I SEE PEOPLE WANTING A MODEL OF THE PHONE THEY WERE REALLY HAPPY WITH AND THEY CAN'T GET IT ANYMORE AND IT'S INNOVATION FOR INNOVATION'S SAKE
THERE ARE INNOVATIONS IN THAT THAT PEOPLE DON'T REALLY WANT
AND I THINK IT'S WONDERFUL OUR COMPANY'S SO R. AND D. BASED
I THINK IT'S REALLY GOOD THAT THIS HAS BEEN VERY MARKET RESEARCH BASED BECAUSE JUST GOING BACK TO MOBILE PHONES
WE SEE IT IN MOBILE PHONES A LOT AND THA THAT'S WHERE WE'VE BORROWED A LOT OF OUR IDE OUR IDEAS FROM
RIGHT
YES
YEAH
YEAH
WELL IT'S INNOVATION FOR MONEY'S SAKE
YEAH
THE THE PEOPLE HAVE TO KEEP BUYING
MM-HMM
BUT FORCING IT ONTO PEOPLE YEAH
YEAH
IT'S THINGS THAT YOU KNOW THEY MIGHT WANT TO BUY THE THING THEY REALLY WANT
BECAUSE THE PHONES HAVE MOVED ON THINGS LIKE THAT
YES
AND YOU CAN'T GET YOU'VE GOT YOUR HANDSET THAT WORKS FINE BUT YOU CAN'T GET THE BATTERY ANYMORE FOR THAT TYPE OF PHONE
MM
MM
OR THERE ISN'T A COVER TO FIT IT OR WHATEVER YEAH
UM
IT'S MADNESS
SEE I THINK
IN CLOSING
UM OUR COSTS ARE BELOW BUDGET WITH RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THEY THE BUDGET BE INCREASED BUT I THINK I DON'T KNOW D WHAT DO YOU THINK
THERE WE GO
DO YOU THINK THAT'S TAKES INTO ACCOUNT UM
OVERHEADS
LIKE US BEING WELL PAID KIND OF A THING
AND THE HEATING FOR THE BUILDING DO YOU THINK OUR BUDGET INCLUDES EVERYTHING ALL THE COSTS THAT ARE GOING OUT
WELL
I THINK IT WAS JUST THE PRODUC UH JUST THE PRODUCTION COST OF THE PHONE
I THINK THAT WAS JUST THE THE PHYSICAL
SO IT LOOKS WELL IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GONNA BE FIFTY PERCENT PROFIT YOU'VE STILL GOT ALL OF THE OVERHEADS TO COME OUT OF THAT
SO MAYBE INCREASING IT YOU WOULD ALSO HAVE TO INCREASE THE PRICE THAT IT'S SOLD AT
BUT I THINK BUT YOU WERE SAYING THAT THAT'S QUITE
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
MAYBE FIFTY PERCENT MORE
YEAH I THINK YEAH I DON'T FROM THE MARKET RESEARCH
I DON'T THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE TO LOOK AT AND FIND A WAY OF RAISING THE CASH FOR
I THINK WE'VE DONE WHAT WE WERE REQUIRED TO DO
AND I THINK THERE'LL HAVE TO BE ANOTHER PROJECT TEAM OR A NEW PROJECT FOR US TO LOOK AT AT THOSE KIND OF THINGS
BUT I THINK IN THE REMIT THAT WE WERE GIVEN IT WAS VERY SPECIFIC
HMM
YEAH
NO
YEAH IT WAS
I THINK WE'VE DONE VERY WELL TO GET WITHIN BUDGET AND IT STILL MAKES SUCH AN INNOVATIVE ITEM THAT I THINK PEOPLE ARE REALLY GONNA WANT
MM
YEAH
YEAH
IT'S A SHAME IT WON'T EVER GET MADE
MAYBE IT WILL
MAYBE SOMEONE'LL R RUN DOWN AND PATENT IT
MAYBE IT WILL
I KNOW
MAYBE THEY ARE GONNA STEAL OUR IDEAS AND SELL IT
WHO KNOWS
I IT'S TOP SECRET
UM IT'S IT IS IT'S A CONSPIRACY GOING ON HERE
THAT'S WHAT IT IS
OH SO WE'VE GOT ABOUT FIFTY MINUTES TO CATCH UP WITH EVERYTHING THAT I FELL BEHIND WITH
SO I'LL BE DELEGATING IN MY UM ROLE AS PROJECT SUPERVISOR SO GOOD LUCK
UM THE PROJECT HAS BEEN EVALUATED WELL AND TRULY
UM AND WE'VE GOT THE MEETING SURVEY AND QUESTIONNAIRE
YEAH
MM-HMM
THERE'S A FINAL QUESTIONNAIRE
IN YOUR YEAH
CELEBRATION YOU DIDN'T TALK ABOUT THAT
I THINK THE CELEBRATION IS THE TWENTY FIVE POUNDS
EITHER THAT OR WE'LL BE DANCING ON THE DESKS
OH
QUESTIONNAIRE
IS THAT IT THEN
OKAY
UM YEAH JUST THE LAST I THINK
AWESOME
I THINK I'VE GOT MINUTES FOR TWO OF THE MEETING AND THE
LAST THINGY
QUESTIONNAIRE DONE
OH I DIDN'T HAVE TO RATE YOU ON HOW MUCH YOU INFLUENCED THE MEETING THIS TIME
WAS THAT NOT THE QUESTIONNAIRE FOR THE HOW YOU FELT YOU'D DONE IN YOUR
THING
BUT DO WE NOT SOMETIMES EVALUATE IN THESE MEETINGS TOO
OH RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH THE THE S YEAH
I DON'T THINK
I THINK YEAH QUESTIONNAIRE SEVEN WAS THE ONE I DID JUST BEFORE THE MEETING
YEAH
MM
I JUST GOT CON
UH I THINK THE FIRST THING WE DO IS INTRODUCE OURSELVES
EVERYBODY READY
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH
I THINK SO
YEAH THAT'S A GOOD PLAN
SO MAYBE WE START WITH YOU
AND EVERYBODY'S NAME AND WHAT YOUR FUNCTION IS
AND I'M UH AN USER INTERFACE MY ROLE IS UH THE MAIN RESPONSIBILITY IS USER INTERFACE
OKAY
YEAH MY NAME IS FRANCINA
AND MY ROLE IS TO DESIGN UH A TELEVISION REMOTE CONTROL
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OKAY
I WANNA FIGURE OUT HOW TO SELL THEM
AND I'M A MARKETING PERSON
MM-HMM
AND YOUR NAME IS
MY NAME IS EILEEN
OKAY
UM UH MY ROLE IS INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER AND MY RESPONSIBILITIES ARE UH UH UM DEAL WITH THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONAL DESIGNS AND SPECIFICATIONS OF USER INTERFACE AND DEALING WITH USER INTERFACE DESIGN
UH I'M JEANNE OUI
YEAH
VERY GOOD
I AM THE PROJECT MANAGER FOR TODAY
AND AS YOU ALREADY KNOW I AM BETTY
SO WHY DON'T WE LOOK AT THE PRESENTATION TO SEE WHAT WE REALLY ARE SUPPOSED TO DO
UM
OKAY
THE TOOLS ARE I THINK WE ALREADY I GUESS THE TOOL IS REALLY OUR THE COMPUTER AS FAR AS I CAN SEE
YES Y OPENING ACQUAINTANCE TOOL TRAINING WELL
MM-HMM
UM I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ANY GREAT DISCUSSION AT THIS POINT
PROJECT PLAN THAT FALLS UNDER THE SAME HEADING PRETTY MUCH
UM
UH WE GET INS EACH OF US WILL GET INSTRUCTIONS AND WE'LL TAKE IT FROM THERE
NO
HERE IS WHAT THIS THING SHOULD BE
UH SHOULD BE ORIGINAL TRENDY AND OF COURSE USER FRIENDLY
THIS THING WE ARE GONNA UM UH DESIGN IS A NEW REMOTE CONTROL
MM-HMM
SO MAYBE YOU WANNA MAKE SOME NOTES OF THAT
OKAY
OKAY
MM-HMM
HERE IS WHAT THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN IS SUPPOSED TO ACHIEVE
UM
ALL RIGHT
THE SAME GOES FOR THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN THERE WILL BE INDIVIDUAL WORK WHIC AND THEN DISCUSSION AFTERWARDS
THAT IS IT'S GONNA BE INDIVIDUAL WORK AND THEN AT THE MEETING WE'LL DISCUSS WHAT UH WE HAVE COME UP WITH
DETAILED DESIGN SAME THING BASICALLY
MM 'KAY SO
THREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF DESIGN THAT WE'RE GONNA BE CONCERNED WITH OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
FUNCTIONAL CONCEPTION
AND DETAILED
I CAN'T WRITE WITH THIS THING
MAYBE WE SHOULD REDESIGN IT
YES
AFTER WE'VE FINISHED THE REMOTE CONTROL WE'LL GET TO THAT
ALL RIGHT
YEAH OKAY
THEN TOOL TRAINING TRY OUT THE WHITE BOARD PARTICIPANT CAN DRAW THEIR FAVOURITE ANIMAL
SO THAT IN CASE WE HAVE TO IN THE NEXT MEETING PRESENT SOMETHING ON THE WHITE BOARD
DOES ANYBODY WANT TO GO AND SEE HOW THE WHITE BOARD WORKS
YOU WANNA GO EILEEN AND
SEE IF I R
OKAY I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO
WHETHER YOU WITHOUT HANGING YOURSELF
SEE IF I REMEMBER HOW TO DRAW A KITTY CAT OR A RABBIT OR SOMETHING
AND REMEMBER YOU HAVE TO PRESS SO IT WORKS
MM-HMM
UM UH UM TRADITIONAL KITTY CAT
SO THAT IT WILL RECORD OKAY
FAT A FAT CAT
I'VE A VERY FAT CAT
OKAY
AND IT LIKES TO SIT LIKE THAT
OKAY
AND YOU'RE FRANCINE RIGHT
WOULD YOU LIKE S LIKE JUST TO SEE UM HOW IT FEELS SO THAT YOU HAVE A LITTLE IDEA
YES I'M FRANCINA
YES SURE
AM I SUPPOSED TO WIPE OFF THAT OR OKAY
IN
NO THAT'S OKAY
NO NO
NO OKAY
I DON'T KNOW WE'LL GET TO THAT LATER
OKAY
WHAT SHOULD I DRAW
SNAKE
I'M GOING TO DRAW A SNAKE
HOW DOES IT LOOK LIKE
OKAY
OKAY
UH OKAY
I HOPE THE KITTY CAT IS HUNGRY 'CAUSE I DON'T LIKE SNAKES
UM SELLING PRICE IS SUPPOSED TO BE TWENTY FIVE EURO
HERE'S THE PROJECT FINANCE UH WHICH OF COURSE WE ALL HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHEN WE DESIGN THIS THING
UH PROFIT AIM FOR THE COMPANY IS FIFTY MILLION EURO THE MARKET RANGE UNLIMITED MEANING INTERNATIONAL
MM-HMM
OKAY
AND THE PRODUCTION COST SHOULD NOT EXCEED HOPEFULLY SHOULD BE LESS THAN TWELVE FIFTY EURO
MM 'KAY THAT SHOULD KEEP EVERYBODY ON THEIR TOES AND CHALLENGED
MM-HMM
PROFIT
UM IS FIFTY MM
SO THESE ARE ALL THINGS OF COURSE TO REMEMBER WITH THE BUDGET AND WHEN YOU DESIGN TO MATERIALS COST ETCETERA
NOW UH THE DISCUSSION I GUESS IS UM DOES ANYONE OF YOU HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH REMOTE CONTROL
OOPS
YEAH OF COURSE USING REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH
AND UM
I EXP I S 'CAUSE WE WE USE 'EM WE USE 'EM RIGHT EVERYDAY
YES
NOW HAVING USED A REMOTE CONTROL FOR YEARS DOES ANYBODY ALREADY HAVE LIKE AN IDEA LIKE THINGS YOU DIDN'T LIKE WITH IT
THINGS YOU WOULD LIKE TO CHANGE THINGS YOU WOULD LIKE TO IMPROVE WITH THIS THING YE ANY FIRST IDEAS
WOULD YOU LIKE IT TO BE SMALLER BIGGER HAVE MORE HAVE MORE BUTTONS ON IT OR MAYBE CLEARLY BETTER MARKED BUTTONS YOU KNOW THINGS LIKE THAT
UH
YEAH I
YEAH
YEAH
LIKE CONTROLLING THE UH TEMPERATURE INSIDE THE HOUSE OR FOR AIR CONDITIONERS OR FOR HEATING SYSTEM
YES I I FEEL THAT ALL THE REMOTE SHOULD BE VERY COMPACT
LIKE UH THE REMOTE CONTROL WHICH WE USE FOR T. V. IT SHOU UH IT SHOULD BE USED F UH FOR SOME OTHER PURPOSE ALSO
AND UM AND IT SHOULD HAVE MULTI PURPOSE
YEAH THOSE WHICH WE GET HERE NOWADAYS IT'S VERY LONG
SMALL RIGHT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OKAY
AUDIO PLAYER
OH
SO IT SHOULD BE A MULTI FUNCTIONAL UH GADGET THAT WOULD UM CONTROL ALL YOUR HOUSEHOLD UH UH MACHINES BASICALLY
YES EXACTLY
YES
HMM
YES
YEAH
DIVIDES US YEAH
EXACTLY
YEAH
AT UM TWELVE FIFTY EUROS PER
WELL
WELL WHO KNOWS IF WE GET A REALLY GOOD DESIGNER MAYBE WE CAN DO THAT
YEAH
WE CERTAINLY CAN TRY TO I AGREE WITH HER THAT TO MARKET SOMETHING SUCCESSFULLY IT SHOULD DO SOME MORE THINGS
NOW OF COURSE THE OTHER THING TO THINK THERE IS MAYBE THE DESIGN
IT SHOULD BE SOMETHING NEW IT SHOULD BE S IT IT SHOULD DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN THAN JUST WHAT WE HAVE
THAT'S RIGHT
YEAH OF COURSE
YEAH
ALL THE ALMOST ALL THE REMOTES
YEAH DESIGN SHOULD BE YEAH IT SHOULD BE DIFFERENT
UM SO YEAH SHAPES RIGHT YOU KNOW LIKE KIDNEY SHAPE FEELS BETTER IN YOUR HAND OR SOMETHING YOU KNOW
MAYBE IT SHOULD DIFFERENT COLOURS OR MATERIALS OR YOU KNOW
LIKE TRENDY NO LIKE F FOR EARLIER WE SAW MAYBE IT SHOULD BE SOMETHING TRENDY YOU KNOW
YEAH MAYBE TEN I DO YEAH COLOURS AND AL SHAPES ALSO
YEAH
YES EXACTLY
ARE DIFFERENT SHAPES
YES
YES
YEAH OF COURSE YEAH
THEY CAN'T FIND IT
I THINK ANOTHER THING THAT WOULD HELP IS UM IF IT BEEPS WHEN YOU CLAP BECAUSE I THINK ONE OF THE BIG THINGS THAT HAPPENS IS PEOPLE LOSE THEM
YEAH OKAY FRIENDLY SHAPE THAT WOULD HELP
YEAH
YES
THAT IS TRUE BECAUSE THEY PUT A NEWSPAPER OR THEY PUT IT BEHIND A PLANT OR WE YOU KNOW WHATEVER
AND AND THEY SUDDENLY THE PHONE RINGS AND THEY WANT TO TURN THE T. V. OFF AND THEY SAY WHERE THE HELL IS MY MY REMOTE CONTROL YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
SO SOME
YEAH
WELL OR YEAH OR IF IT'S REALLY IF IT'S REALLY IN A DARK SPOT THAT IT GIVES OUT A A SOUND OR A SIGNAL
SO IF LOST
MM-HMM
YEAH SOME BEEP OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO THAT WE CAN GO
UH SO SO IT'S REALLY THE BEEP OR OR A LIGHT SHOULD BLINK
OR A B
IF LOST UH SIGNAL WITH B THROW SIGNAL YOU KNOW
SHOULD HA
YEAH
A FLUORESCENT SIGNAL YEAH
MM 'KAY
YEAH YEAH
YEAH MAYBE IT SHOULD HAVE A LIGHT SO THAT WE CAN WE CAN JUST RECOGNISE WHERE IT IS
EXACTLY I MEAN JUST THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING
I'M JUST SAYING THROW SIGNAL MEANING JUST WHETHER IT'S A BEEP OR WHETHER A LIGHT OR
MAY NOT BE BEEP
BEEP OR UH IT'S A LIGHT MAYBE IT'S A LIGHT
AND DO YOU THINK A GOOD C C UM CLUE FOR THAT IS THAT IT WOULD RESPOND TO A CLAP OR IT WOULD RESPOND TO YOUR VOICE OR IT WOULD RESPOND WHAT WHAT SHOULD YOU HAVE TO DO TO MAKE IT BEEP OR BLINK
IT GE HAS A SENSOR AND IT GIVES OUT A SIGNAL WHETHER THAT BE A LIGHT SIGNAL OR A BEEP
IN IN THAT MOMENT IT HAS A SENSOR I IT IT GETS A CERTAIN DARKNESS
IN IN OTHER WORDS IF IT'S LIKE IN A DARK SPOT UH MEANING YOU KNOW LIKE A NEWSPAPER IS ON TOP
OKAY MY MY IDEA IS MAYBE THAT THE MINUTE IT'S REALLY HIDDEN
A SWEATER IS ON TOP OR IT IT'S BEHIND A PLANT
I MEAN THAT WE CAN DISCUSS THAT LATER YOU KNOW
AT THAT MOMENT IT'S IT'S LIKE IT'S LIKE UM WHAT YOU CALL IT A LIGHT S SENSORS YOU KNOW
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OKAY SO
YES
OKAY
YEAH PROBABLY YEAH PROBABLY IT'S A YEAH YEAH
YEAH
AND UH
SO THE LIGHT SENSOR WOULD ACTIVATE THE SIGNAL
YOU KNOW THERE WOULD BE RIGHT YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME KIND OF SENSOR AND I I THINK UH VOICE OR CLAPPING IT'S NOT SPECIFIC ENOUGH
THAT'S RIGHT
UH I KNOW THERE ARE THE LAMPS AND STUFF YOU KNOW YOU CAN CLAP ON AND OFF BUT I THINK THEY ONLY WORK TO CERTAIN DEGREE AND
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YES
BUT IT COULD BE SOMEPLACE REALLY OBVIOUS AND YOU STILL WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO FIND IT
YEAH OF COURSE THAT DIDN'T
WHAT WITH
BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE SILLY
WELL BECAUSE YOU'RE S BECAUSE YOU'RE SILLY
THEN IN THAT CASE
I I WE CAN'T DO IT
OH YEAH WELL BUT THEN THOSE PEOPLE WE CAN'T HELP EVERYBODY
I MEAN IT COULD BE ON WELL I IF IT WERE LIKE ON TOP OF YOUR BOOKCASE AND YOU USUALLY KEPT IT ON THE COFFEE TABLE UM
YOU KNOW WELL MAYBE WE HAVE TO MOVE ALONG OKAY
OKAY WE HAVE UH YEAH WE HAVE TO MOVE ALONG BUT I THINK WE HAVE SOME GOOD GOOD POINTS TO START WITH HERE
YEAH GOOD POINT
OKAY SO WELL YOU GOT THE NOTICE UM UH
THE WORKING DESIGN I GUESS THAT'S THE FUNCTION I. D. UH WHO IS THIS
I THINK YOU ALL DID YOU GET UH NOTICES ON YOUR COMPUTER FOR THIS
THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER THAT'S YOU
OKAY THE NEXT MEETING WILL BE IN THIRTY MINUTES
ME YEAH
YES
YEAH
YEAH IT'S FUNCTIONAL DE YEAH EXACTLY TECHNICAL
OKAY
SO WE LOOKING FOR A WORKING DESIGN WHEN WE COME BACK
YEAH
UH WORKING DESIGN YEAH IT'S IT'S UH MAINLY TECHNICAL FUNCTIONAL DESIGN
THEN
THAT WOULD BE YOUR IDEA
I MEAN THE PRICE IS GIVEN BUT THAT WAS
SO YOU HAVE A WORKING DESIGN AND THEN A FUNCTIONAL DESIGN
AND OF COURSE PRICE
THAT IT THAT IT THAT THE PRICE IS A GOOD PRICE
AND THEN THE TECHNICAL FUNCT YOU ARE THE TECHNICAL FUNCTION SO SO YOU ARE THE WORKING DESIGN
AND THE MARKETING MANAGER IS COMING UP WITH SOME USER REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATION LIKE FRIENDLINESS AND WHAT WE JUST DISCUSSED IN GENERAL
YEAH FUNCTIONAL DESIGN AND YOU
OKAY
MM-HMM
WE HAVE TO JUSTIFY THAT PRICE BY HAVING SUFFICIENT FEATURES TO MAKE IT SELL AT THAT PRICE
THAT'S RIGHT
THAT'S RIGHT
I THINK THAT'S THE END OF THE SHOW
YEAH
AND YOU KNOW SPECIFI YOU YOU WILL GET SPECIFIC UM INSTRUCTIONS FOR THAT
OR UH SUGGESTIONS
SO UM WE HAVE WELL WE HAVE A TWEN TWO TWO TWO THREE MINUTES
UM ANY QUESTIONS AT THIS POINT
MM
I THINK BASICALLY BASICALLY YOU WILL GET INSTRUCTIONS TO WORK WITH AND IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS UH UH I GUESS YOU CAN UH
OKAY
YEAH
REALLY
OKAY I THINK I HAVE ENOUGH TO THINK ABOUT 'TIL OUR NEXT MEETING
OKAY
HOW ABOUT YOU PEOPLE
MM-HMM
YEAH EVEN I HAVE I THINK YEAH
YEAH EVEN I HAVE
YES
MM-HMM
'KAY
OKAY
ALRIGHT WELL UH
YEAH SO LET'S SEE
THEN UH WE SEE YOU IN ABOUT THIRTY MINUTES
AND SEE WHAT WE CAN COME UP WITH
YES
HMM
OKAY VERY GOOD
OKAY
YES
OKAY
YEAH
OKAY IS EVERYBODY READY
YEAH
YEAH I'D TO JUST PUT ON MY MICROPHONE HERE AND I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU
MM-HMM
OKAY
UM I TAKE IT YOU ALL HAVE RECEIVED INSTRUCTIONS AS TO WHAT YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO DO AND UM
MM
YES
I THINK THE MARKETING MANAGER PROBABLY SHOULD GO FIRST ADDRESSING THE NEEDS AND DESIRES
OKAY YOU WANT ME TO START RIGHT NOW
YEAH MM-HMM
OKAY
WELL COULD YOU UM PUT MY SLIDES UP 'CAUSE I THINK IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL IF UH WE LOOKED AT THE SLIDES AT THE SAME TIME
OKAY
YOU'RE PARTICIPANT FOUR
I'M PARTICIPANT FOUR I BELIEVE
YES UH-HUH
'KAY
OKAY AND NOW I CAN UH FULL SCREEN
OPEN
UH OKAY OKAY
THERE WE GO
OKAY WELL I THINK WE HAVE INTRODUCED OURSELVES SO THE FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS ARE IS IS PART OF MY GOAL BUT WHY DON'T WE PASS RIGHT TO THE SECOND SLIDE
AND THEN FULL SCREEN
AND TH THE REASON I JUST PUT THAT THERE LIKE THAT IS THAT UH IN THE INIT IN THE INITIAL STAGE I THINK I SHOULD JUST BE OPEN TO LOTS OF SUGGESTIONS
YOU KNOW YOU CAN SAY ANYTHING YOU WANT NO MATTER HOW SILLY IT SOUNDS YOU KNOW IT SHOULD RUN YOUR CAR
UM I THOUGHT THAT THE METHOD I SHOULD FOLLOW WOULD BE GATHER SUGGESTIONS FROM EVERYBODY
RIGHT WELL UM SINCE I'M IN CHARGE OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE SHOULD PUT ON THIS THING SINCE I HAVE TO TRY TO SELL IT
CAUSE THAT'S WHERE M MY DISCUSSION STARTS
IT SHOULD HEAT UP YOUR MOTOR IF SHOULD UM TURN ON YOUR C. D. WHATEVER YOU WANT IT TO DO UM AND THEN AS WE GO ON WHAT WE'LL HAVE TO DO IS ACCEPT AND ELIMINATE THESE SUGGESTIONS ACCORDING TO UM DESIGN AND BUDGET FEASIBILITY
MM-HMM
'KAY
AND THEN THE THINGS THAT SEEM THE MOST ATTRACTIVE THAT TO UH TO A CUSTOMER WE'LL TRY TO THEN PRIORITISE THOSE
BECAUSE IF WE'RE GONNA SELL THIS THING I THINK THE BEST TIME TO SELL IT IS AS A CHRISTMAS PRESENT
SO THAT WAS UM WHAT I MEANT THERE
SO IN THE BEGINNING JUST HAVE A BIG PUDDLE OF THINGS THAT WE ANYBODY CAN TH THROW ANYTHING IN AND THEN JUST WEED THINGS OUT THAT CAN'T BE DONE FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER
SO I'LL BE COMING TO YOU UM FREQUENTLY AS THE INDUSTRIAL EXPERT TO TELL ME HOW HARD IT'S GONNA BE TO ADD A FEATURE OR HOW EXPENSIVE IT'S GONNA BE OR IF YOUR TIME
AND AS I SAID ON THE SLIDE THERE CONSULTING THE INDUSTRIAL ENGINEER ABOUT THAT AND THE OTHER THING IS TIMING IS REALLY GONNA BE AS IMPORTANT AS MONEY
IF IT TAKES FIVE YEARS TO DEVELOP THIS IT'S JUST SOMETHING WE CAN'T DO
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
HMM-HMM
MM
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
WE WANT SOMEBODY TO SEE IT AND THINK IT'S GEE I JUST GOTTA HAVE THAT
UM AND THEN I'LL BE COMING TO YOU AS THE USER INTERFACE PERSON TO TRY TO TELL ME FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW WHAT ARE THE MOST FRIENDLY FEATURES THAT WE COULD PUT ON IT AND TRY TO PRIOR HELP ME WITH THAT PRIORITISING OF UH OF THE FEATURES AND OF THE THE LOOK AND THE COLOUR AND I'LL BE COMING BACK TO YOU TO HELP WEED OUT THOSE SUGGESTIONS FROM THAT POINT OF VIEW
AND TAKE OUT THEIR WALLET AND BUY IT
TWENTY FIVE EUROS MAKES A NICE LITTLE PRESENT AND WE WANT IT TO BE AN IMPULSE PURCHASE
'CAUSE ANYTHING THAT YOU DON'T ALREADY HAVE OUT THERE IN SEPTEMBER SHOWING IT AROUND ISN'T GONNA SELL FOR CHRISTMAS
SO IT'S GOTTA BE REALLY ATTRACTIVE AND IT BUT IT'S GOTTA GO TO MARKET BY SEPTEMBER
MM
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY CAN WE GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE
A LOT OF TIMES THE THING THAT WORKS THE BEST FROM AN ENGINEERING POINT OF VIEW ISN'T THE THING THAT SOMEBODY'S REALLY JUST GONNA TAKE OUT THEIR WALLET AND BUY FOR CHRISTMAS FOR FOR THEIR CHILD OR FOR THEIR HUSBAND OR WHATEVER
SO I'LL BE COMING TO YOU FOR HOW MUCH IS IT GONNA COST US AND HOW LONG IS IT GONNA TAKE YOU
AND I'LL BE COMING TO YOU TO TELL ME WHAT'S GONNA MAKE SOMEBODY TAKE OUT THEIR WALLET YOU KNOW
WHAT WHAT'S WHAT'S GONNA REALLY BE WHAT THEY CALL A SIZZLE 'CAUSE WE GOTTA SELL THIS SIZZLE
MM MM-HMM
WHAT FEATURES
S SELLABLE
YES
YES
I HAVE TO WIND UP
THE STEREO SET UM MAYBE SOMETHING ELSE CUTE LIKE A COFFEE POT OR ONE OTHER APPLIANCE OR MAYBE A LAMP
AT THE BUDGET THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT AND AT THE PRICE POINT WE'RE LOOKING AT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE IT WORK THE T. V. THE V. C. R.
ALRIGHT I I ALREADY DID A LITTLE BIT OF RESEARCH AFTER OUR FIRST MEETING WHERE WE THREW OUT SOME IDEAS AND IT LOOKS TO ME THAT WITHIN THE BUDGET THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THE UH THE WHOLE HOUSE IDEA REALLY ISN'T GONNA BE POSSIBLE
SO I'D LIKE YOUR SUGGESTIONS TO COME BACK TO THE OTHER SLIDE WHERE I WAS SAYING WE WE COULD SUGGEST ANYTHING
NOT SOMETHING LIKE YOU KNOW WHOLE HOUSE CONTROL WHAT'LL BE AND THEN I FOUND ON THE INTERNET FROM FROM MY RESEARCH THAT SOME EXTENDED ELECTRONIC ENTERTAINMENT CONTROL SHOULD BE POSSIBLE
I'D LIKE THE SUGGESTIONS TO BE REALLY SPECIFIC SO THAT WE'LL HAVE A LIST OF THINGS WE CAN CROSS OFF
MOSTLY BECAUSE THEY FEEL THAT IT'S TOO COMP COMPLEX A TASK TO UM TO TO INCLUDE OTHER THINGS AND THEY ARE CONCERNED WITH THE TIME TO MARKET
UM WE HAVE RECEIVED INSTRUCTION FROM HIGHER UP THAT CERTAIN THINGS SHOULD NOT BE UH CONSIDERED
UH OKAY CAN CAN I AT THIS POINT INTERJECT UM SOMETHING
UM THE ONE THING FOR EXAMPLE SOMETHING TO ELIMINATE MAYBE THAT'S THE TELETEXT BECAUSE THAT'S SORT OF OUTDATED WITH THE INTERNET
AND ACCORDING TO TO HIGHER MANAGEMENT THE IT SHOULD ONLY CONTROL THE T. V.
YEAH SURE
OKAY
OKAY
MM-HMM
COMPLICATED YEAH OF COURSE
YEAH
OF COURSE YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
THESE WERE INSTRUCTIONS FROM HIGHER UP SO WE HAVE TO ELIMINATE UH THESE THINGS SO IT'S ONLY GONNA BE T. V.
AND THAT THERE'S NO MISTAKE THAT IT COULD BE SOMEBODY ELSE WHO IS BRINGING THIS OUT
SO I JUST WANTED TO INTERJECT THIS HERE SO WE'RE NOT GETTING TOO MUCH OFF TRACK HERE WITH UH WITH THE THINGS WE WANNA LOOK AT
BUT THE ONE THING MAYBE THAT COULD BE UM ELIMINATED IS THE TELETEXT UH IDEA
AND THAT THE CORPORATE COLOUR AND DESIGN ARE BEING USED ON THE PRODUCT
SO THAT IT'S EASY THAT THAT THAT THEY CAN BE EASILY IDENTIFIED AS A PRODUCT OF OF OF THE COMPANY
UM AND THE AND THE THIRD THING THAT THEY WANNA MAKE SURE UM THAT THEIR THAT THE CORPORATE IMAGE IS BEING MAINTAINED
OKAY SO THAT'S SOMETHING
MM-HMM
OKAY SO
OKAY
MM 'KAY
OKAY
UH WE WANNA S MAKE IT AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE WE WANNA MAKE IT UM OBVIOUS AND INTUITIVE TO USE
AND THEN THE THINGS ABOUT FINDING IT WE TALKED ABOUT THE A LIGHT EMITTING THING AS WELL AS UH MAYBE A BEEP
AND THAT WAS THIRTY FOUR PERCENT BUT EVEN MORE IMPORTANT THE THING THAT WE DID ADDRESS IN OUR LAST MEETING THAT FREQUENTLY IT'S LOST SOMEWHERE IN THE ROOM
AND I THINK THAT THOSE ARE THINGS AFTER MY RESEARCH THAT WE DEFINITELY WANNA TRY TO INCORPORATE
ALRIGHT THANKS FOR THAT
'CAUSE A LOT OF THEM TAKE TOO MUCH TIME TO LEARN HOW TO USE
'KAY CAN WE GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE
UM ALRIGHT NOW OTHER THINGS THAT I FOUND OUT ON IN MY RESEARCH IS THAT THE COMPLAINTS THAT PEOPLE HAVE ABOUT THE REMOTE CONTROLS THAT ARE OUT THERE NOW
UM SO THOSE ARE TWO THINGS THAT WE DEFINITELY DO WANNA ADDRESS
THAT IS THE SELLING POINT THE THING THAT'S GONNA MAKE IT AN IMPULSE PURCHASE
THEY'RE NEVER GONNA COME BACK AND BUY IT
YOU'VE GOTTA MAKE IT ATTRACTIVE ENOUGH SO THEY BUY IT NOW NOW NOW W NOW IS A BIG WORD IN IN MY BOOK FOR SELLING THIS THING
OKAY SO MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES IN THIS UM PROJECT ARE REALLY HAVE TO CONCENTRATE ON THE SIZZLE
IF SOMEBODY SAYS OH I'LL COME BACK AND GET IT NEXT WEEK YOU'RE DEAD
UH BECAUSE ONCE THERE'S NO BE BACK WELL IN SALES THEY ALWAYS SAY YOU KNOW BE BACKS DON'T COME BACK
SO IT HAS TO HAVE ENOUGH VALUE THAT WHEN SOMEBODY LOOKS AT IT THEY SAY UH TWENTY FIVE EUROS I'M NOT GONNA TAKE THAT
OKAY THAT'S UH ABOUT IT FOR ME RIGHT NOW
AND IN ORDER TO MAKE IT REALLY SELLABLE WE'VE GOTTA SHORTEN THE LEARNING CURVE MAKE SURE IT'S REALLY INTUITIVE AND EASY TO USE
SO WE'VE GOTTA CONCENTRATE ON THE FEATURES THAT HELP YOU FIND IT AND I'VE ALREADY SAID THIS SEVERAL TIMES BUT I PUT IT DOWN IN WRITING HERE
WE HAVE TO HAVE AS FEW BUTTONS AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE MORE BUTTONS IS MORE CONFUSION SO THAT'S WHY I'M SAYING SIMPLICITY IS GOOD
IT SHOULD BE AN ATTRACTIVE IMPULSE PURCHASE AT TWENTY FIVE EUROS
FINDING IT'S IMPORTANT OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN'T USE IT IF YOU CAN'T FIND IT
HAS TO BE SO GREAT THAT THEY'RE GONNA SAY UH TWENTY FIVE EUROS ISN'T MUCH
UM AND THEN MAYBE A MOTTO LIKE WE PUT FASHION IN ELECTRONICS MIGHT BE SOMETHING WE CAN USE IN OUR MARKETING CAMPAIGN
YEAH
OKAY
AND UH
MM-HMM
WHO WOULD BE NEXT UH I GUESS THAT WOULD BE YOU
MM-HMM
YOU WANT ME TO GET YOUR SLIDE SHOW UP
YEAH 'KAY
YEAH YEAH SURE
THANK YOU
AND YOU ARE NUMBER THREE
NUMBER TWO
NUMBER TWO YEAH
YEAH EXACTLY
OKAY
UH CAN YOU MAKE IT UH FULL SCREEN PLEASE
OKAY
MM-HMM
YEP
NO IT'S LIKE A WELL YOU YOU HAVE TO PRESS HERE
THE THIR THIRD
THE CUP CUP SHAPE HERE
YEAH YEAH UH-HUH
YEAH EXACTLY
UH SO TODAY I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE WORKING DESIGN OF THE REMOTE CONTROLLER
UM CAN YOU GO TO THE NEXT SLI SLIDE PLEASE
THERE MM-HMM
OKAY
MM-HMM
LIKE A T. V. OR A AIR CONDITIONER SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO
THE METAL IS LIKE UH IN A REMOTE CONTROLLER YOU HAVE A CHIP INTEGRATED CIRCUIT WHICH IS LIKE A BRAIN OF THE REMOTE CONTROLLER
IT SHOULD BE A BATTERY BECAUSE UH UH REMOTE CONTROLLER SHOULD BE LIKE YOU YOU YOU SHOULD TAKE IT T TO WHEREVER YOU WANT AND THEN UM UH TH THIS INTEGRATED CIRCUITRY TAKES ENERGY FROM THE POWER SOURCE AND WHATEVER LIKE IF YOU PRESS A BUTTON IT'S LIKE A INPUT FOR THE REMOTE CONTROLLER AND IT TAKES THE INPUT AND IT IT TRANSFORMS INTO A INFRO INFRARED BITS AND IT SENDS IT INTO THE DEVICE
IT TAKES THE POWER FROM A BATTERY SAY A BATTERY IT IT CAN BE A ELEC AN ELECTRIC SUPPLY LIKE YOU HAVE TO UH LIKE UH SWITCH CONNEC CONNECT CONNECT YOUR REMOTE CONTROLLER TO UH POWER SUPPLY FROM THE YOU KNOW ELECTRICITY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
MM-HMM
CHANGE THE VOLUME CONTROL AND UH SO UH I THINK IT'S HARD TO DESIGN A REMOTE CONTROLLER FOR MULTIPLE UH DEVICES
UH A REMOTE CONTROLLER IS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO A SINGLE DEVICE
AND THE T. V. IT SHOULD TRANSLATE THAT INTO LIKE CHANGE THE CHANNEL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
IF YOU WANT TO DESIGN IT FOR MULTIPLE DEVICES THEN YOU SHOULD MAKE ALL THE DEVICES COMPATIBLE WITH THE FREQUENCY LIKE UH TH THE REMOTE CONTROLLER IT SENDS SOME BITS SOME UH WAVES LIKE WITH A PARTICULAR FREQUENCY THE DEVICE SHOULD KNOW WHAT THE FREQUENCY IS
IT SHOULD RE RE RECOGNISE THE UH WAVES WHICH ARE COMING FROM THE REMOTE CONTROLLER AND IT SHOULD TAKE THE ACTION LIKE IF YOU PRESS A BUTTON CHANNEL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THEN UH THE REMOTE UH REMOTE CONTROLLER WILL SEND A SEND A SE SEND A SIGNAL
SIGNAL
RECEIVE
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MULTI PURPOSE
YEAH WELL THAT'S ALREADY BEEN ELIMINATED BY MANAGEMENT SO WE'RE OFF THE HOOK
YO AND IT'S YEAH BUT IT'S SO
UH YEAH
UM
YEP
YOU WANT TO CHANGE THE CHANNEL YOU WANT TO CONTROL THE VOLUME YOU YOU WANT TO UH MUTE UH MUTE THE UH T. V. OR YOU WANT TO HAVE A CHILD LOCK OR YOU WANT TO DO SOME OPERATIONS THERE'S A THERE SHOULD BE SOME DEVICE TO TELL WHAT TO DO TO THE UH IN UH INTEGRATED CIRCUIT SO THAT THE INTEGRATED CIRCUIT CAN S SEND THE SIGNALS AND T. V. CAN PERFORM THE ACTIONS
SO UH USER INTERFACE CONTROLS THE CHIP AND ACCORDINGLY THE MESSAGES LIKE THERE SHOULD BE A USER USER IN INTERFACE LIKE YOU KNOW SWITCH PAD OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUTTONS SHOULD BE THERE
SO UH YOU CAN CONTROL WHATEVER YOU WANT
MM OKAY
SO CAN YOU GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE
OKAY
SO I I JUST WOULD LIKE TO UH ADD SOME EXTRA FEATURES TO THE REMOTE CONTROLLER UM I THINK THESE ARE THE VERY SIMPLE FEATURES AND UH THEY DON'T TAKE MUCH UH UH MUCH OF THE UM UM INVESTMENT ALSO
IT'S LIKE EL THE TEXT OR BUTTONS WHICH UH WHICH ARE THERE ON THE UH REMOTE CONTROLLER THEY THOSE WE CAN MAKE UH UM LIKE FLUORESCENT UH THEY'LL BE LIKE LIGHT EMITTING IF IT IS DARK SO THAT YOU CAN FIND YOUR REMOTE CONTROLLER IF IT IS DARK
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
AND THER THERE SHOULD BE A BEEP IF MANY BUTTONS ARE PRESSED IF SUPPOSE A CHILD IS PLAYING WITH THE REMOTE CONTROLLER AND A AND SHE SHE OR HE IS PRESSING THE BUTTONS ALL AT THE TIME THEN THERE SHOULD BE A BEEP SAYING THAT IT'S THIS THIS IS NOT A A YOU KNOW A A ACTION
IF MAKE IT USEABLE FOR MORE THAN ONE DEVICE IT'S A IT'S HARD BUT I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE BUT IT UH YEAH YEAH YEAH SO IT'S IT'S OKAY
AND THERE SHOULD BE A CHILD LOCK
YEAH YEAH
THERE CAN BE NO ACTION TAKING TO THAT SO
LIKE UH UH YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO LOCK YOUR REMOTE CONTROLLER SO THAT UH UM WHATEVER BUTTONS ARE PRESSED BY A CHILD THEY CAN'T BE LIKE Y YOU I YOU IF YOU HAVE KI KIDS AND ALL THEN THEY'LL BE PL PLAYING WITH THE REMOTE CONTROLLERS SO CAN LOCK THE REMOTE CONTROLLER
AND UH DIFFERENT SHAPES THAT WE CAN DO LIKE UH WE CAN HAVE YOU KNOW A ALL ANIMALS SHAPES OR YOU KNOW COMFORTABLE UH WHI WHICH CAN FIT INTO YOUR HANDS AND UM SO THAT UH
YEAH WELL YEAH WELL THAT HAS BEEN E THAT HAS BEEN ELIMINATED SO THAT'S THAT'S UNFORTUNATELY A MOOT POINT NOW
MM-HMM
WELL WE ALREADY ELIMINATED THAT
ELIMINATED
TO D THE SHAPE IS UH
NOW THAT'S GOOD FROM A MARKETING POINT OF VIEW THE FUN THE FUN SHAPE
AND THAT YOU YOU SAY THAT WON'T ADD TOO MUCH TO THE BUDGET
YEAH YEAH YEAH AND COLOURS ALSO DIFFERENT COLOURS AND
YEAH I
MM-HMM COLOURS
NO NO NO IT WON'T UH I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE LIKE YOU CAN HAVE YOU KNOW FOR UH IF YOU WANT THER THERE TO BE MORE
IT JUST BUILD A MOULD BASICALLY AND UH YOU KNOW
YEAH YEAH
IT'S IT'S JUST A S SHAPE SO IT DOESN'T MATTER
YES EXACTLY
AS THE BUDGET WE'RE LOOKING AT IF YOU BUILD ONE MOULD I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING TO MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE WHETHER IT'S GONNA BE SQUARE OR
YEAH
DO YOU THINK THERE'S ANY CHANCE OF UM HAVING SER IN HAVING BASICALLY THE SAME MACHINE WITH THE SAME BUTTONS BUT MAYBE SEVERAL DIFFERENT SHAPES
YEAH THAT IS ALSO POSSIBLE I UH YEAH I I YEAH
OH YES
IS THAT GONNA BE A POSSIBLE
'CAUSE THAT MIGHT HELP WITH THE MARKETING
YES
I THINK I THINK WE WILL HAVE TO LOOK AT THE BUDGET ON THAT BUT I THINK IN PRINCIPLE THAT THAT WOULD BE THAT WOULD BE KIND OF FUN
YOU KNOW
YEAH THAT WILL BE
YEAH YEAH
BECAUSE WE HAD SOMETHING SORT OF SEXY FOR ADULTS AND WE COULD HAVE SOMETHING SORT OF SILLY FOR CHILDREN OR A LITTLE ANIMAL SHAPE OR IN A OR A LITTLE ELEPHANT SO THEY CAN REMEMBER WHERE IT IS
MM-HMM
YEAH
SILLY FOR CHILDREN
YEAH THAT'S WHAT YEAH
YEAH FOR CHILDREN YEAH EXACTLY
LIKE AN ANIMAL OR
LIKE A DOLL OR
YEAH
SO I THINK UH WE NEED TO MAKE SOME BUTTONS WHICH ARE WHICH ARE LIKE UM UH F IN UH IN INTENDED FOR TWO OR THREE OPERATIONS
IF YOU HAVE LESS FEATURES THEN YOUR REMOTE CONTROLLER WON'T BE ATTRACTIVE
YEAH EXACTLY
YEAH
AND AND THE BUTTO BUTTONS ALSO I THINK IF YOU WANT TO HAVE MORE FEATURES IN YOUR REMOTE CONTROLLER THEN THERE SHOULD BE MORE BUTTONS
IF THERE ARE MORE BUTTONS THEN IT WILL BE MORE COMPLICATED
SO IF YOU WANT TO HAVE LESS BUTTONS WE CAN HAVE THAT OPTION BUT I THINK IT WILL COMPLICATE THE MATTER MORE I THINK SO
LIKE IF YOU PRESS ONE BUTTON IN ONE MODE THEN IT WILL CHANGE THE CHANNEL IF YOU PRESS THE OTHER BUTTON IN ANOTHER MODE IT WILL CHANGE THE COLOUR
YES
MM
THE CHANGING MODES WAS SOMETHING I MEAN YOU AND I ALL F ALL FOUR OF US WE WORK WITH COMPUTERS ALL THE TIME
CHANGING MODES IS NOTHING FOR US BUT PEOPLE WHO
I THINK I THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'LL HAVE TO DISCUSS UM WITH THE USER INTERFACE PERSON BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF ARGUMENT TO BE MADE FOR ONE BUTTON FOR ONE FEATURE
BECAUSE I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS WERE COMPLAINING ABOUT IN MY WHAT I FOUND OUT IN MY RESEARCH IS WHEN THEY COMPLAINED ABOUT HOW HARD IT IS TO LEARN A NEW ONE
WELL
YEP YEAH
YES
MM-HMM
YEAH IT'S LIKE YOU KNOW YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
OKAY
AND AND IT'S A SMALL BUTTON AND AND IT THEY DON'T PRESS IT EXACTLY YOU KNOW SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENS N NOT THEIR FAVOURITE CHANNEL COMES UP BUT SOMETHING ELSE AND THEY'RE VERY FRUSTRATED YOU KNOW
YEAH A LITTLE ELDERLY A LITTLE ARTHRITIC HAND YOU KNOW
N AND
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH YES
SOMETHING ELSE
AND THAT'S AND THAT'S THE KIND OF THING PEOPLE LEARN BY FEEL AND UM YOU DON'T FEEL THE MODE CHANGE
SO UM MAYBE HAVING BUTTONS BE VARIOUS SHAPES MIGHT BE A HELP TOO
YOU KNOW LIKE THE A TRIANGLE IS FOR THE VOLUME AND A SQUARE IS FOR CHANGING CHANNELS SO THAT PEOPLE CAN UH DEVELOP A TACTILE SENSE OF IT
BUT WE'LL GET TO THAT WITH YOU
YEAH
YEAH YEAH YOU DON'T US YEAH YEAH USUALLY
YEAH SHAPES ALSO DIFFERENT SHAPES
YEAH THAT WILL
MM-HMM
CHANNELS
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH AND ALSO TEXT SHOULD BE VERY CLEAR SO THAT THERE THERE WON'T BE ANY AMBIGUITIES AND UH
MM MM-HMM
YES
THAT'S RIGHT YEAH
NOW THAT'S A GOOD POINT
YEAH
SO YEAH
YES
AND UH DISPLAY CLOCK I IF YOU WANT MORE FEATURES THEN WE CAN DISPLAY A CLOCK IT I I DON'T THINK IT WILL TAKE ANY MONEY EXTRA MONEY BECAUSE ANYWAY WE HAVE AN INTEGRATED CIRCUIT I THINK WE CAN JUST DEFINITELY FIT THAT FEATURE INTO THE CIRCUIT SO IT'S
YEAH THAT'S THAT'S A GOOD THAT'S A GOOD ONE BECAUSE THE CLOCK WOULD BE REALLY FRIENDLY AND AND WHEN IS YOUR FAVOURITE SHOW COMING ON AND
YES
MM-HMM MM-HMM
YEAH AND WE DISPLAY A CLOCK
MM YEAH
YEAH
YES
YEAH YOU'RE SITTING THERE ALREADY OR MAYBE YOU HAVE NO OTHER UH
YEAH AND THEN YOU CAN JUST SEE YOUR REMOTE CONTROLLER YEAH YEAH YEAH SO
YES
YEAH THAT'S THAT'S GOOD THE CLOCK IS GOOD
YEAH AND A LOT OF TIME THERE'S NOT A CLOCK ON THE SCREEN
AND YOU HAVE TO GO SOMEWHERE BUT YOU JUST WANNA LOOK AT THE NEWS FOR A MINUTE
OKAY
YEAH
AND UH BULBS
UH COMPONENTS UH THE MAIN COMPONENTS WE NEED FOR UH IT HA LIKE BUTTONS AND UH UNDERNEATH THAT THERE SHOULD BE SWITCH
LIKE UH WE CAN HAVE A BULB LIKE WHENEVER WE ARE OPERATING A REMOTE CONTROLLER OR UH WHENEVER THE T. V. IS ON SUPPOSE
UH CAN YOU GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE
THEN THE REMOTE CONTROLLER SHOULD AUTOMATICALLY HAVE A B S LIGHT
YEAH
MM-HMM
HMM
MM-HMM
WHENEVER THE T. V. IS ON REMOTE CONTROLLER WILL HAVE A LIGHT
MAYBE WE CAN HAVE THAT
THEN IT WILL BE LIKE IF YOU SWITCH ON YOUR T. V. THROUGH ANOTH ANOTHER SOURCE
NOT FROM THROUGH A REMOTE REMOTE CONTROLLER AND YOU YOU LOST YOUR REMOTE CONTROLLER MAYBE YOU CAN FIND WITH THE LIGHT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
AND THEN UH INFRARED BULBS
UM THIS IS LIKE UH WHEN IT IS DARK
MM-HMM
YEAH MM-HMM
MM-HMM
CHIP WHICH IS LIKE A BRAIN TO THE REMOTE CONTROLLER WHICH DOES ALL THE OPERATIONS
AND WIRES CONNECTING ALL CHIPS WHICH IS UH LIGHTS EVERYTHING SO THERE SHOULD BE WIRES
AND BATTERY THERE SHOULD BE A BATTERY FOR POWER SUPPLY AND A CHIP
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
OKAY
YOU KNOW DIFFERENT SHAPES OR WHATEVER IT IS THERE SHOULD BE A CASE TO PUT TO GIVE A SHAPE
YEAH
AND UH UH OF COURSE THERE SHOULD BE A CASE WHERE WE CAN KEEP ALL THE THINGS AND
TO KEEP THE REMOTE
YEAH
CASE
A CASE HOLDER
A HOLDER REMOTE HOLDER
YEAH HOLDER
HOLDER YEAH MM-HMM
UM UH CAN YOU MOVE ONTO THE NEXT SLIDE
UM NEXT SLI SLIDE PLEASE
UM I HAVE REFERRED THE SITE UH THE HOMEPAGE OF THE UM OUR WEBSITE UH FROM WHERE I HAVE UH UH I GOT S FEW POINTS
MM-HMM
THAT'S IT THAT'S IT FROM ME NOW
OKAY
OR
SO IT UM WE SHOULD VISIT THIS SITE AND HAVE A LOOK AT UH WHAT'S UP THERE
UM
WELL YOU DON'T HAVE TO
UH IT'S NOT LIKE THAT
I HAVE REFERRED THE PAGE TO GET NEW IDEAS OR LIKE WHAT CAN BE THE WORKING DESIGN TO HOW IT WORKS AND ALL AND SO AND SO
OKAY
SO IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL IF WE HAD A LOOK AT THAT
OKAY
YEAH IF YOU WANT
OKAY THANK YOU
YEAH IT'S OKAY
COULD YOU GO BACK TO THAT SLIDE WHERE SHE HAD THAT UH S SLIDE UP BETSY
UH IT'S ACTUALLY THERE NOW THERE ON THE SCREEN
THIS ONE
YEAH OKAY THANK YOU
AND FRANCINE
PARTICIPANT TWO
YOU ARE NUMBER TWO
NO NO I'M THREE
YES
YOU'RE THREE
SO I FOUND OUT THAT UH BUT UH THE MAIN PURPOSE OF A REMOTE IS TO UH F CONTROL THE FUNCTION OF A TELEVISION AT A FAR OFF DISTANCE AT REMOTE DISTANCE
I CAN MAKE IT FULL
YES YES YES
AS UH USER INTERFACE DESIGNER I DID A LITTLE RESEARCH TO FIND OUT WHAT ARE THE FEATURES WHICH A USER WOULD LIKE TO HAVE ON THEIR REMOTE
OKAY
YEAH CAN YOU PLEASE GO ONTO THE NEXT SLIDE
MM-HMM
OKAY
WOULD YOU WANT IT FULL FULL SCREEN
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
UH A REMOTE CONTROLLER SHOULD HAVE A SWITCH ON OFF BUTTON BY WHICH A USER CAN SIT ANYWHERE IN THE ROOM IN FRONT OF THE T. V. AND HE CAN CONTROL THE FUNCTIONALITIES DIFFERENT FUNCTIONALITIES OF THE T. V.
NOW FOR THAT
THERE SHOULD BE A SIGNAL UH SOMETHING LIKE A RADIO WAVE OR A INFRARED LIGHT OR A LED WHICH CAN BE USED TO CHANGE THE DIFFERENT FUNCTIONALITIES IN THE TELEVISION IF THE USER WANTS TO UH CHANGE THE CHANNELS OR INCREASE THE VOLUME HE CAN CHANGE IT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
NOW THERE SHOULD BE SOME TIMER TO SET FOR VIEWING A PARTICULAR A PARTICULAR PROGRAMME OR SWITCHING ON AND OFF A UH A PARTICULAR PROGRAMME ACCORDING TO THE USER CHOICE
YEAH MM-HMM
ON THE ON ON THE REMOTE
YES
YES
AND THE T. V. WILL AUTOMATICALLY IT WILL SWITCH ON AT THAT PARTICULAR TIME
AND UH THE UH THE UH AND THE ONE OF THE FEATURE A USER WOULD LIKE TO HAVE IS THE COMPACTNESS OF THE CO REMOTE
THEN THE PARENTS CAN LOCK THAT PARTICULAR CHANNEL SO THAT THE CH CHILDREN CANNOT VIEW THAT CHANNEL
SO IF IF HE WANT TO VIEW A PARTICULAR PROGRAMME AT SAY NINE O'CLOCK HE CAN SET THE TIME
SO HE CAN USE THAT KIND OF UH UH PROPERTIES OF FEATURES AND THEN THERE SHOULD BE A CHILD LOCK SYSTEM IF A PARTICULAR CHANNEL IS NOT TO BE VIEWED BY A PARTICULAR UH FOR A CERTAIN AGE
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
RIGHT
MM-HMM
YES
BY YOUR CHILD MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
UH T THE REMOTE SHOULD BE COMPACT AND IT SHOULD HA IT SHOULD HAVE AS MANY BUTTONS AS POSSIBLE FOR CONTROLLING DIFFERENT FUNCTIONALITIES OF THE T. V. TELEVISION
AND UM UH AS UH UH THIS IS MY PERSONAL PREFERENCE THAT IT SHOULD BE IN THE SHAPE OF A T. IN ALPHABET FOR MORE COMPACTABILITY
MM-HMM
LIKE UH THE MATERIAL WHICH WHICH WHICH IS USED FOR REMOTES SHOULD BE HUMAN FRIENDLY IT SHOULD NOT CAUSE ANY SKIN DISEASE OR SOMETHING SOME AL ALLERGY TO EITHER CHILDREN OR TO UM AD ADULT PERSON
AND IT SHOULD HAVE AN UH IT CAN HAVE AN ALARM CLOCK A A PERSON IF SOME IF SOMEBODY WANTS TO GET UP AT AROUND EIGHT EIGHT P. M. THEN HE CAN SET THE TIME AND IT CAN BE USED AS AN ALARM CLOCK
AND UH AND UH AND IT IS ONE MORE POINT WHICH I NOTED IT DOWN
AND I DON'T THINK IT WILL COST MUCH TO SET AN ALARM CLOCK INSIDE A REMOTE
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM 'KAY
MM
MM-HMM
IF THERE IS A CLOCK THEN THERE CAN BE A ALARM CLOCK
YEAH SURE
MM-HMM
AND AN ALARM CLOCK YEAH THAT SHOULD THAT SHOULD BE OKAY
SO IN EVEN IN THE DARK THE USER CAN KNOW WHAT BUTTONS TO USE TO SWITCH ON A PARTICULAR CHANNEL
UH CAN ME WE CAN USE THE FLUORESCENCE TO LIGHT UP THE BUTTONS SO DIFFERENT UH BUTTONS WILL GLOW DIFFERENTLY
YES AND AS JOHN REECE SAID THE BUTTONS CAN BE
HE UH HE SHOULD NOT BE HARMED IN ANY WAY
AND UH UH THE DESIGN OF THE UH UM REMOTE SHOULD BE IN SUCH A WAY THAT THERE SHOULD NOT BE ANY SHARP PROJECTIONS SO THAT IF A CHILD PLAYS WITH A REMOTE
HMM
AND FINDINGS UH I FOUND OUT UH Y UM ON DIFFERENT SITES THAT UH THERE ARE DIFFERENT REMOTES WHICH CAN BE USED
THERE ARE REMOTES WHICH USE THE INFRARED FOR CONTROLLING THE DIFFERENT FUNCTIONALITIES THERE ARE REMOTES WHICH USE THE RADIO WAVES TO CONTROL THE FUNCTIONS AND THERE ARE UH
SO UH THERE YOU HAVE DIFFERENT UH TYPES OF REMOTES FOR DIFFERENT LIGHT SOURCE WHICH ARE USED WHICH CAN BE USED FOR CONTROLLING THE DIFFERENT FUNCTIONALITIES OF A TELEVISION
NEXT SLIDE
NOT
AND IF A PERSON IF IF IF PARENTS WANTS THE TELEVISION TO BE SWITCHED OFF BY TEN O'CLOCK THEN IT SHOULD BE SWITCHED OFF TEN O AT TEN O'CLOCK AUTOMATICALLY
SO THAT NOBODY ELSE COMES LATER AND USE IT
AND THESE ARE MY FEW PERSONAL PREFERENCES LIKE IT CAN BE USED FOR A MULTIPURPOSE USE
UH NO UH LIKE IT CAN IT CAN BE USED AS A T. V. CONTROL AS PLUS AN ALARM CLOCK TO SET AN ALARM A TIMING AND IT SHOULD HAVE A CHILD LOCK
AND THEN TO SAVE ELECTRICITY UH THERE SHOULD NOT BE UH MUCH S MOVE UH LOTS OF CIRCUITS AND ALL THAT
IT'S LIKE A T OKAY IT'S LIKE A TIMER IT'S LIKE A LOCK TO THE TELEVISION
TIMER YEAH MM-HMM MM-HMM
TIMER
YEAH AND THEN YOU CAN USE A TIMER AS WELL
YES
YEAH THAT'S IT
UH OKAY NOW I HAVE
SO UH THE FIRST THING IS PRO MAYBE A LITTLE EASIER ON UH WHO IS OUR TARGET GROUP
HOWEVER UH THE DECISION WE HAVE TO TAKE IN THIS MEETING IS WHO IS OUR TARGET GROUP
ON MY SLIDE SHOW BASICALLY WE ALREADY WE HAVE ALREADY DONE THE AGENDA AND UH ON THE CLOSING UH BASICALLY THERE WILL BE LUNCH BREAK AND ALL THAT
AND UH WHAT FUNCTION WORKING DESIGN HOW HOW DOES IT WORK
SO THESE ARE THE TWO THINGS WE SHOULD COME UP WIT WITH
OKAY
UM
I GUESS IN MANY WAYS EVERYBODY
EVERYBODY WHO HAS A T. V.
MM T. V. YEAH
T. V. TELEVISION WE WAS
YEAH AND I THINK TODAY THERE ARE PROBABLY NOT MANY PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE A T. V.
THERE ARE A FEW BUT IN GENERAL NOT
DON'T T. V. YEAH
NOW TALKING ABOUT THE TARGET GROUP WHICH IS IN A SENSE EVERYBODY BUT I THINK WITHIN THE TARGET GROUP WE HAVE SUBGROUPS
UM THEN WE HAVE JUST THE NERVOUS PEOPLE WHO CAN NEVER PRESS A LITTLE BUTTON ON ANYTHING UM UNLESS IT'S REALLY VERY CLEAR
SO I THINK THAT'S UH ONE GROUP THAT'S CERTAINLY IMPORTANT
I MEAN THAT'S A QUESTION UM WHETHER THAT'S IMPORTANT THAT CHILDREN CAN REALLY USE IT OR NOT
AND UH I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH WE WANT TO CATER TO CHILDREN'S USE
WE HAVE WE HAVE EARLIER IT WAS MENTIONED ABOUT UM FOR EXAMPLE ELDERLY PEOPLE WHO HAVE LIMITED FUNCTION WITH THEIR FINGERS AND HANDS
MM-HMM
HMM
YEAH
MM
WHETHER THAT DIFFERENT SHAPE ALSO INCLUDES MAYBE DIFFERENT UH BUTTONS UH FOR DIFFERENT GROUPS
AND UM I DUNNO WHAT YOU FEEL ABOUT WHETHER WE CAN JUST SAY WE HAVE ONE TARGET GROUP AND FOR THIS ONE TARGET GROUP WE'RE GONNA DESIGN THIS ONE THING OR WHETHER WE'RE LOOKING AT WHAT WE LIKE WE WE TALKING ABOUT DIFFERENT SHAPES
SO THIS THESE ARE JUST SOME THOUGHTS I HAVE ON IT
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
SO IF YOU'VE DESIGNED SOMETHING THAT'S VERY ATTRACTIVE TO CHILDREN UM THE MUMMY PLEASE MUMMY PLEASE UM YOU KNOW WE WANT IT NOW WE WANNA GO TO THE STORE AND SEE IT UM THAT HAS UH A LOT OF MARKETING PULL
WELL YOU KNOW THERE'S THE OLD MOTTO CHILDREN UNDER SIX NEVER SHOP ALONE
MM-HMM
THAT HAS A LOT OF THAT HAS A LOT OF APPEAL BUT I THINK UH I'M I'M TALKING ABOUT THE FUNCTIONALITY NOW ON IT WHETHER WE'RE LOOKING AT DIFFERENT GROUPS
BUT THE QUESTION IS REALLY WHO IS OUR TARGET GROUP
I THINK THE CHILDREN ISSUE CAN BE ADDRESSED WITH THE SHAPE AND WITH COLOURS
YOU KNOW LIKE YOU MAKE IT NICE AND PINK FLUORESCENT BANANA COLOUR OR WHATEVER YOU KNOW YEAH FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW
MM
MM-HMM
THAT'S RIGHT
YEAH
DIFFERENT COLOURS
YES
YOU CAN MAKE A BANANA SHAPED ONE
YEAH
MM
MM-HMM
DO WE LOOK AT ONE TARGET GROUP
AND WITH THE TWENTY FIVE EUROS YOU KNOW CAN WE CAN WE AFFORD TO HAVE UH I'M ASKING THE TECHNICAL PEOPLE HERE WHETHER UM TO LOOK AT
SORT OF SUBGROUPS WITH MAYBE DIFFERENT BUTTONS FOR EACH GROUP HOW MUCH WOULD THAT THROW US
OUT OF THE COST WE ARE SUPPOSED TO RESPECT
MM
RESPECT
NO UH GENERALLY WE CAN WE CAN DESIGN A REMOTE WHICH IS MAINLY FOR PEOPLE WITH UH F AGE FROM TEN TO UM FORTY AND AND THEN WE CAN ADD ON UH SPECIFIC FUNCTIONAL BUTTONS FOR CHILDREN AS WELL AS THE ELDERLY PEOPLE OR THE PEOPLE WIT WITH WHO HAVE NERVOUS PROBLEMS
YES
OKAY
RIGHT
WITH WITH
MM-HMM
YEAH
WE CAN DESIGN DIFFERENT REMOTES FOR DIFFERENT PEOPLE LIKE FOR AGED PEOPLE THERE WILL BE BIG BUTTONS AND YOU KNOW
WELL THAT'S THAT'S
THEY WOULD LIKE TO BUY JUST ONE AND UM JUST ONE WHICH CAN BE USED ALL THE THREE UH
BUT IN A FAMILY IN A FAMILY THERE WILL BE A AGED PERSON CHILDREN AND A MIDDLE AGED BUT THEY CANNOT BUY THREE DIFFERENT REMOTES
CHILDREN AND EVERYBODY YEAH
BUT SPECIFICALLY IF Y IF LIKE ELDERLY PEOPLE WANT BIG BUTTONS THEN YOU CAN'T REALLY MAKE A BI BIG REMOTE CONTROLLER SO MAYBE SPECIFICALLY YOU CAN DESIGN A BIG CON REMOTE CONTROLLER FOR ELDERLY AND FOR CHILDREN
YEAH OF COURSE THAT WE CAN DO
LIKE IN A DIFFERENT YOU KNOW
WHAT ABOUT THE ELECTRONICS
THAT'S NOT REALLY GONNA CHANGE MUCH IS IT
YEAH
COST EFFECTIVE
NO IT IT DOESN'T COST YEAH
THAT THAT W THAT WON'T CHANGE MUCH WILL IT UH
NO
DOESN'T DOESN'T DOESN'T MATTER
YEAH
AND I THINK THE HOW WILL IT FUNCTION IS PROBABLY THE QUESTION OF THE BUTTONS YOU KNOW WITHIN THE TARGET GROUP OR SUBGROUPS
THE QUESTION IS ONLY WHETHER OUR BUDGET WILL ALLOW TO HAVE MORE THAN ONE DESIGN IN A SENSE
THE THE QUEST THE QUESTION TO BE ADDRESSED HERE IS ONLY WHO IS THE TARGET GROUP AND HOW WILL IT FUNCTION
BUT THE QUESTION IS HOW MUCH WILL THAT SET US BACK IF LET'S SAY UH FORTY PERCENT WE MAKE LARGE BUTTONS AND THE REST WE MAKE REGULAR BUTTONS FOR EXAMPLE
I MEAN THE BASIC DESIGN I UNDERSTAND WILL BE THE SAME
I D I WOULDN'T THINK SO
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
SO THAT REMAINS TO S TO BE SEEN BUT UH THE TARGET GROUP AS A WHOLE IS IS BASICALLY EVERYBODY WITH A T. V.
UM YOU AS AN INDUSTRIAL PERSON
AND IN THAT CASE WE COULD PROBABL MOULDED PLASTIC ISN'T ALL THAT EXPENSIVE IS IT
UM THE SAME ELECTRONICS AND BASICALLY ALL THAT'S GONNA BE DIFFERENT IS THE PLASTIC CASE
THAT'S RIGHT AND CAN WE CAN WE IS IT EVEN FEASIBLE TO MAKE ONE ONE REMOTE CONTROL WITH SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE
OR WOULD WE HAVE TO USE THE SAME ELECTRONICS AND MAKE THREE DIFFERENT SHAPES
YES
YEAH WELL THAT'S THAT'S THE QUESTION
HMM-HMM
UH NO
MM I I I DON'T THINK NO
IT'S NOT
WELL MAYBE THERE'S THERE'S AN IDEA YOU KNOW T THE NEW FOR EXAMPLE NEW PORTABLE PHONES
SO YOU CAN HAVE A STRIPED ONE OR YOU CAN HAVE A FLUORESCENT BLUE ONE OR WHATEVER AND MAYBE SOMETHING LIKE THAT
AND THEN IF PEOPLE REALLY WANT MORE COLOURS THEY CAN BUY IT SEPARATELY
THEY HAVE LIKE REMOVABLE PLASTIC CASES
THAT IN EACH PACKAGE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE YOU YOU HAVE YOU HAVE FOR EXAMPLE UH YOU HAVE LET'S SAY A FLUORESCENT BLUE ON IT BUT THEN YOU HAVE UH ANOTHER COLOUR OR STRIPE WHATEVER THAT ALREADY COMES IN A PACKAGE
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
OKAY
WELL THERE'S A REAL IDEA YEAH
MM-HMM
HMM
YEAH
RIGHT
YEAH LIKE FOR MOBILE PHONES WE HAVE UH DIFFERENT YOU KNOW COVERS LIKE DESIGNS AND ALL SO THAT W WE CAN HAVE THAT
YOU KNOW YES
UM
MM-HMM
YES
THEN THEY CAN GO TO THE STORE AND FOR A FEW UH FRANCS OR EUROS WHATEVER THEY CAN BUY AN ALTERNATE PACKAGE WITH ANOTHER TWO COLOURS IN IT YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW
AND BUT LIKE IF IF THEN EVERYBODY IS IS IS TIRED OF THE FLUORESCENT BLUE AND OF THE STRIPED OR WHATEVER THEY HAVE AS ANOTHER ONE IN THE PACKAGE
THAT'S RIGHT
UH YEAH
YEAH
AN ALTERNATE PACKAGE
OKAY
YEAH
BUT UH YEAH I I HAVE A DOUBT LIKE WILL IT BE COST WISE EFFECTIVE IF WE IF WE DESIGN A REMOTE HAVING ALL THE UH DIFFERENT FEATURES FOR DIFFERENT PEOPLE OR DESIGNING THREE DIFFERENT UM REMOTES FOR THREE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF PEOPLE
WELL I THINK I THINK THE IDEA HERE IS TO UH TO TO D DESIGN ONE REMOTE AND WHAT THE ONLY CHANGE IS GONNA BE UM THE FUNCT D T YEAH UH THE FUNCTIONAL FUNCTIONAL COSMETICS IF YOU WANT TO PUT IT THAT WAY
UM HAVING MAYBE LARGER BUTTONS OR BUTTONS THAT LIGHT UP OR BUTTONS THAT ARE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY SHAPED FOR PEOPLE UH EITHER FOR CHILDREN UM
YEAH BUT UH
WELL I THINK WE CAN ONLY AFF YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
COSMETIC
OF TH OKAY
OKAY
MM-HMM
FIVE MINUTES THAT WAS I GUESS THA THAT'S THE OLD MESSAGE
WARNING FINISH MEETING NOW
UM UM
FINISH MEETING NOW
WELL WE MAY HAVE TO COME BACK TO ONE OR TWO OF THESE POINTS AT OUR NEXT MEETING BUT UM
IF WE DO SOME MORE RESEARCH MAYBE WE
YEAH MAYBE YEAH YEAH
BUT I THINK I I THINK TO SUM IT UP THE TARGET GROUP IS BASICALLY EVERYBODY
IF MONEY PERMITS WE CAN ADDRESS SOME FEATURES FOR SOME SUBGROUPS WITHIN THAT
MM-HMM
OKAY MM-HMM
HMM YEAH I THINK MAYBE SEVENTY PERCENT IS A UNIQUE UH UH REMOTE CONTROLLER AND THIRTY PERCENT IS YEAH IT'S SORT OF LIKE YEAH
OKAY BUT WE HAVE TO L
DO WE AGREE DO WE
DO WE AGREE ON ON THAT IN PRINCIPLE LIKE MONEY WILL TELL WHETHER WE WILL BE ABLE TO DO THAT OR NOT
YEAH YEAH OF COURSE YEAH
OKAY FAIR ENOUGH
YES
SO NOW I UNDERSTAND IT'S LUNCH BREAK
OKAY
MM-HMM
AND UM
SO THAT'S WHAT WE WILL DO
OKAY
OKAY
SO HANK YOU VERY MUCH
THANK YOU
AND WE'LL SEE YOU AFTER LUNCH
OKAY
HELLO EVERYONE
HI
HI
HI
UM HOW UH HOW WE DOING
YEAH GOOD
UH FIRST WE GOING UH OVER THE MINUTES OF THE LAST MEETING MORE OR LESS
UM IN THE LAST MEETING UH THE MARKETING MANAGER HAD PRESENTED UH HER METHOD OF WORKING MEANING GATHERING I SUGGESTIONS
MM-HMM
FROM EVERYONE TO SEE HOW SHE BEST COULD MARKET UH THIS THIS PRODUCT AT THE WITHIN THE BUDGET UH THAT WAS GIVEN
UH IN GENERAL THE IDEA IS THAT IT SHOULD BE SOMETHING THAT IS NOT DIFFICULT TO USE
SO WE SHOULD ADDRESS THAT
UM IT'S ALSO AN ITEM THAT PEOPLE LOSE A LOT
AND OF COURSE IT SHOULD BE SOMETHING
S S THAT IS VERY SIMPLE TO USE
OR LIKE SHE SAYS PUT SOME SIZZLE INTO IT IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER
IN ADDITION TO THAT TO MAKE IT SELL OF COURSE UH THE MARKETING MANAGER W WISHES THAT IT BE VERY ATTRACTIVE
SO THAT THE PEOPLE ARE BUYING IT NOW BECAUSE IN PARTICULAR WITH SMALLER ITEMS
THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT FACT 'CAUSE UM IF THEY SAY WELL I GO HOME AND THINK ABOUT IT THAT WON'T WORK
UM ALSO MENTIONED WAS IT SHOULD BE UH IT SHOULD HAVE A VERY SHORT LEARNING CURVE
AND MAYBE IT COULD BE SOLD BY USING A SLOGAN
HMM
OUR TECHNICAL MANAGER HAS THEN SAID THAT SHE FEELS IT SHOULD HAVE A CHIP
THAT HAS INFRA RED BITS AND IT HAS AN INTERFACE CONTROLS W INTERFACE THAT CONTROLS THE CHIP
THERE SHOULD BE EXTRA FEATURES LIKE LID BUTTONS MAYBE A BEEP
IF TOO MANY BUTTONS ARE PRESSED
THEREFORE MESSAGES UH WILL BE CONTROLLED IN THE SAME MANNER
MM UH UH CHILD LOCK UM AND UH MAYBE A DISPLAY CLOCK SO THAT PEOPLE COULD UM
YOU COULD SEE THE TIME YOU KNOW WHAT SHOW THEY WANT TO WATCH
ALSO MENTIONED WAS UH MAYBE DIFFERENT SHAPES
SO THE COMPONENTS OF THE THING SHOULD BE BUTTON BULBS INFRA INFRA RED BULBS BATTERY CHIPS WIRES AND MAYBE SOME KIND OF A HOLDER
UH FOR THE FOR THE UH ITEM
FRANCINO WHO IS OUR UM INTERFACE DESIGNER UM UH HAS MENTIONED THAT THE THAT IT
OF COURSE SHOULD HAVE AN ON OFF BUTTON AND ALSO HAS MENTIONED AN INTERESTING FEATURE THAT IT SHOULD HAVE MAYBE A CHANNEL LOCK
INTERFACE DESIGNER
PARTICULARLY WITH MAYBE SMALL CHILDREN THAT THEY COULDN'T UH WATCH A CHANNEL THAT IS UNDESIRABLE
IT SHOULD BE COMPACT
HER PERSONAL FAVOURITE WAS IT SHOULD BE T SHAPED
AND MAYBE HAVE AN ANAR ALARM CLOCK
AND THE MATERIAL SHOULD POSSIBLY BE NOT OF NON ALLERGIC NATURE
UH THE DIFFERENT SYSTEMS UH THAT EXIST ARE INFRA RED OR RADIO WAVES
UH MAYBE IT SHOULD HAVE UH ELECTRI ELECTRICI ELECTRICITY SAVING FEATURE
AND EVEN POSSIBLY A TIMER TO SO THAT PEOPLE CAN PROGRAM THEIR FAVOURITE UH UH PROGRAM ON TH RIGHT FROM THE REMOTE
YES
UH ARE WE ALL IN AGREEMENT THAT THAT'S ABOUT WHAT WE DISCUSSED LAST TIME
OKAY
YEAH
YES
MM-HMM
YEAH I THINK THAT PRETTY MUCH IS IT
YEAH
OKAY THEN WE I'M LOOKING FOR THREE PRESENTATIONS
AND UH I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THE ORDER MATTERS MUCH UH I DON'T I DON'T THINK SO SO WHOEVER W WANTS YEAH OKAY
OKAY I CAN START FIRST
OKAY
NOW MY SLIDE PLEASE
OKAY
OKAY YOUR SLIDES
OH COME ON CLOSE ALREADY
AND THAT'S NUMBER TWO RIGHT
THREE
THREE
PARTICIPANT THREE
YES
OKAY
OKAY
NOW AS AN INTERFACE DESIGNER I WOULD GIVE MORE EMPHASIS ON THE INTERFACE
HOW THE REMOTE LOOKS LIKE SO THAT IT IS SELLABLE IT IS ATTRACTIVE TO CUSTOMERS
NEXT PLEASE
LIKE YOU CAN HAVE THE NUMBERS ONE TWO THREE FOUR UP TO NINE
THIS MESSAGES COULD BE UH SWITCH ON OFF MESSAGE OR SWITCH TO NEXT CHANNEL MESSAGE OR SWAPPING THE CHANNELS OR SWITCHING ONTO A PARTICULAR CHANNEL
NOW THE FUNCTION OF A REMOTE IS TO SEND MESSAGES TO THE TELEVISION
OKAY
NINE CHANNEL UH SWITCHES
NINE WHAT
PARDON ME
MM-HMM
NINE CHANNEL SWITCHES
MM-HMM
IS YEAH
YES NINE NUMBERS
AND THEN YOU HAVE SWAPPING OF UH BUTTON BY WHICH USING WHICH YOU CAN SWAP THE CHANNELS IF YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE THE THIRD CHANNEL YOU CAN SWAP IT TO THE FOURTH CHANNEL OR VICE VERSA
MM-HMM
THEN IT SHOULD HAVE A NEXT BUTTON AND NEXT BUTTON CHANNEL BY WHICH YOU CAN KEEP ON UH V UH MM EH SCROLLING THE CHANNELS ONE BY ONE
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE
GOING TO THE NEX NEXT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE A BUTTON WHICH SHOULD WHICH CA WHICH CAN BE USED FOR INCREASING OR DECREASING THE VOLUME
MM-HMM
THEN THERE SHOULD BE A CHANNEL WHICH CAN TRIGGER THIS MECHANISM IN THE TELEVISION SO THAT THE USER CAN SEE UH THE THE SUBTITLES ON THE SCREEN
THEN THERE SHOULD BE A BUTTON WHICH CAN GIVE SUBTITLES FOR A PARTICULAR PROGRAM WHICH IS GOING ON A TELEVISION
FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU ARE WATCHING A FRENCH PROGRAM AND YOU WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A SUBTITLES IN ENGLISH
MM-HMM
COLOUR OF THE PICTURE THE CONTRAST SHARPNESS BRIGHTNESS OF THE PICTURE
THEN THERE SHOULD D UH THERE SHOULD BE SOME BUTTONS WHICH CAN CONTROL FEATURES LIKE THE COLOUR
NOW THERE SHOULD BE A MEMORY SWITCH
BUT HE HE CAN REDUCE THE SOUND HE CAN BRING THE VOLUME DOWN AND HE CAN WATCH HE CAN UH WHILE TALKING HE CAN WATCH THE T. V.
NOW THE MOST IMPORTANT FEATURE I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE IN MY REMOTE WOULD BE THE SPEECH RECOGNITION FEATURE
SUDDENLY IF IF IF UH UH VIEWER HE GETS A TELEPHONE CALL AND IF HE WANT HE DOESN'T WANT TO SWITCH OFF THE UH T. V.
THERE SHOULD BE A MUTE BUTTON
IT'S AN INTEGRATED PROGRA PROGRAMMABLE SAMPLE SENSOR SPEAKER UNIT
SO A REMOTE CAN BE TH CAN BE UH DESIGNED WHICH CAN HAVE THE VOICE RECOGNISERS YOU CAN RECORD YOUR OWN VOICE
MM-HMM
WHICH CAN BE RECOGNISED BY AS VOICE RECOGNISER IN THE TELEVISION FOR EXAMPLE
SO THE T. V. WILL HAVE SOME RECOGNISER WHICH WILL RECOGNISE THE USER'S VOICE AND ACCORDINGLY IT WILL CHANGE ITS FUNCTIONALITIES
UH TH NOW THE THE UH YEAH THE REMOTE WILL AUTOMATICALLY IT WILL SWITCH TO THE NINTH CHANNEL
SO THIS IS ONE OF THE VERY IMPORTANT FEATURE A REMOTE CONTROL CAN HAVE
IF YOU WANT TO SEE WE IF YOU WANT TO SEE THE NINTH CHANNEL IF YOU SAY JUST SAY NINTH CHANNEL
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
SO THIS IS ONE ONE OF THE INTERFACE WHICH CAN BE CREATED
MM-HMM
A VERY SIMPLE INTERFACE WHICH HAS ALL THE T UH UH IMPORTANT FEATURES
THEN PLEASE NEXT SLIDE
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
SO CAN YOU GO ON T T UH TO THE NEXT SLIDE
SO UH SOMETIMES THE USER FINDS IT VERY DIFFICULT TO RECOGNISE WHICH BUTTON IS FOR WHAT FUNCTION AND ALL THAT
THEN THESE ARE SOME OF THE REMOTES WHICH ARE DIFFERENT IN SHAPE AND COLOUR BUT THEY HAVE MANY BUTTONS
SO YOU CAN YOU CAN DESIGN AN INTERFACE WHICH IS VERY SIMPLE AND WHICH IS USER FRIENDLY
EVEN A KID CAN USE THAT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH SO THIS IS ONE OF THE INTERFACE OR ONE OF THE REMOTE WHICH HAS THIS VI VOICE RECOGNISER
AND THIS HAS MULTI PURPOSE USE IT CAN BE USED FOR T. V. IT CAN BE USED FOR CABLE SATELLITE IT CAN BE USED FOR V. C. R. D. V. D. S AND AUDIO
MM-HMM
AND THIS HAS IN BUILT VOICE RECOGNISER
AND THIS COMES WITH DIFFERENT COLOURS DIFFERENT SHAPES
YEAH NOW THIS IS AN INTERFACE FOR A CHIL UH FOR A REMOTE UH UH WHICH A CHILD CAN USE
CAN YOU GO ON TO THE NEXT SLIDE
UH THIS IS USER FRIENDLY IT'S VERY ATTRACTIVE AND UH CHILDREN CAN USE IT AS WELL AS THEY CAN PLAY WITH IT
MM-HMM
MM
MM-HMM
AND THIS THIS UH CHILD UH INTERFACE HAS MINIMUM BUTTONS AND ALL THE IMPORTANT UH BUTTONS ARE THERE IN THIS SMALL COMPACT
ATTRACTIVE CHILD INTERFACE
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE
NOW THIS IS A BIG OVER SIZED REMOTE WHICH CANNOT BE MISPLACED OR IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO MISPLACE
THIS
YOU DON'T KNOW ME
I COULD LOSE THAT IN A MINUTE
SO THIS IS NO THIS IS A VERY BIG YOU CANNOT MISPLACE IT ANYWHERE
SO THIS IS A JUMBO UNIVERSAL REMOTE CONTROL AND IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO IM MISPLACE OR LOSE
MM-HMM
THIS I THIS IS ONE SUCH INTERFACE WHICH CAN BE CREATED
AND THE PERSONAL PREFERENCE UH WOULD BE A SPE UH UH TO INCORPORATE SPEECH RECOGNISERS UH WHICH WILL RESPOND TO USER'S VOICE FOR A PARTICULAR UH FUNCTION
MM-HMM
RIGHT
THANK YOU THAT'S
MM-HMM
UH ANY COMMENTS ON UH HER PRESENTATION
OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH
UM I DON'T THINK THAT'S GONNA BE OUR IMPULSE PURCHASE AT THE CHECKOUT COUNTER
UM WHAT UH I'M NO SUGGESTION'S BAD
I DON'T THINK THAT WE CAN GET UH THE T SHAPE IS GOOD THE CHILD ONE IS GOOD THE TOO BIG TO MISPLACE I THINK IT'S JUST FUNNY
BUT UH WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO NARROW IT DOWN A LITTLE MORE
IT'S IT'S GONNA BE A LITTLE BIT TOO UNWIELDY
WELL UM LOOKS LIKE WE STILL HAVE QUITE A CHOICE OF THINGS OUT THERE
MM-HMM
MM YES
OKAY
YEAH I I TH I THINK
OKAY
BUT UH AS FAR AS THE DECISION MAKING WE GETTING TO THAT AFTER AFTER BUT IF I JUST WANTED TO KNOW WHETHER ANYBODY HAD ANY ANY ANYTHING TO ADD TO HER PRESENTATION
NO I THINK THE THESE ARE HER PRESENTATIONS
MM-HMM
YEAH MM
HAVE TO COME BACK TO THAT LATER
OKAY
WE CAN
NO I THINK HER PRESENTATION WAS GOOD AND SHE REALLY EXPLORED ALL THE OPTIONS
YEAH
MM RIGHT
MM-HMM
HO WHO WANTS TO GO NEXT UM
YEAH MAYBE
OKAY AND YOU
MM-HMM
PARTICIPANT TWO
UH OKAY
UH THE NEXT ONE SORRY
IT'S IT WAS THE OLD ONE
OOPS
COMPONENTS
MM-HMM
OKAY
THE COMPONENTS DESIGN
UM THIS TIME I'M I'M GOING TO UM CONCENTRATE MORE ON THE COMPONENTS AND THE TECHNICAL SIDE OF THE REMOTE CONTROLLER DESIGN
UH CAN YOU GO ON TO THE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
UH THE FIRST ONE IS CASE TO KEEP ALL THE COMPONENTS LIKE INTEGRATED CIRCUIT BATTERY ETCETERA ETCETERA IT'S LIKE
I HAVE JUST BRIEF UH DOWN FEW UH COMPONENTS WHICH WE REQUIRE FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL UH CONSTRUCTION
AND UH UH THERE ARE NO HARMFUL MATERIALS USED IN THAT
UH IT CAN BE A PLASTIC ONE HARD PLASTIC SO THAT IT CAN BE STRONG
EVEN IF YOU JUST UH UH YOU KNOW IF YOU IF IT FALLS DOWN THEN IT DOESN'T BREAK
SO IT SHOULD BE STRONG
AND IT SHOULD BE RECYCLABLE
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
BLUE RED GREEN SO UH UH WE HAVE TO USE UH SOME COLOURING COMPONE COMPONE COMPONENTS
UH AND UH YEAH AND ALSO UH USING OF COLOURING COMPON COMPONENTS LIKE UH IF WE WANT TO HAVE DIFFERENT COLOURS
MM-HMM
GOOD POINT
AND UH THE SECOND IMPORTANT THING IS UH UH UH INTEGRATED CIRCUIT
SUPPOSE IF IT IS THIRTY EIGHT DEGREES OUTSIDE FORTY DEGREES OUTSIDE
AND UH IT SHOULD BE WITH UH UM EQUIPPED WITH TIMER AND ALARM FACILITY
IT SHOULD IT SHOULD UH BE ABLE TO RE UH RESIST THE UH TEMPERATURE UH UH HIGHS AND UH HIGH TEMPERATURES AND LOW TEMPERATURES
IF IT IS NOT EFFICIENT THEN EVERYTHING WI IS GOING TO BE UH LIKE UM THE LEF ESS LESS EFFICIENT SO IT YOU SHOULD WE SHOULD HAVE A HIGHLY SOPHISTICATED ONE
AND IT SHOULD BE RESISTANT TO HIGH AS WELL AS UH LOW TEMPERATURES
UH WHICH UH WE CAN USE A HIGHLY SOPHISTICATED ONE BECAUSE IT'S LIKE THE IT'S LIKE THE HEART OF THE REMOTE CONTROLLER
AND THE UH OTHER COMPONENT WE SHOULD UH WE HAVE IN THE REMOTE CONTROLLER IS A RESISTOR UH WHICH IS LIKE UH UH I IT IS VERY VERY MUCH IMPORTANT FOR THE ELECTRICITY UH FLOW THROUGH THROUGH THROUGH THE UH REMOTE CONTROLLER AND UH ALSO A CAPACITOR WHICH IS A B WHICH IS A M I THINK IT'S IT'S LIKE A BATTERY
CAPACITOR
CAN YOU GO ON TO THE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
A BATTERY UH I WOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST ONE THING UH IF WE
UH A DIODE A TRANSISTOR A RESONATOR
THESE ARE ALL THIS UH TECHNICAL UH ELECTRI ELECTRONIC COMPONS UH COMPONENTS WHICH ARE WHICH WE HAVE TO USE IN A REMOTE CONTROLLER
EVEN IF IT IS A LOW PERFORMANCE BATTERY IT CA IT CAN'T L IT CAN'T CHARGE MUCH
UH IF WE WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE A RES RECHARGEABLE BATTERY THEN WE SH WE NEED NOT GO FOR A HIGH PERFORMANCE BATTERY
SO IN THAT WAY WE CAN CUT CUT THE COST BUT W UH UH THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE THE BATTERY AS RECHARGEABLE ONE
THEN ALSO WE CAN IF IT IS A RECHARGEABLE ONE THEN UH PEOPLE CAN USE IT FOR A LONG TIME
IT IT IT'S NOT A HIGH VOLTAGE BATTERY
MM-HMM
WHEN YOU PRESS A BUTTON
AND HOW IT WORKS HOW THE REMOTE CONTROLLER WORKS
AND WE WE HAVE A CIRCUIT BOARD UH IN A REMOTE CONTROLLER
CAN YOU GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE
GO AWAY
THANK YOU
AND IT WILL SEND SOME SIGNALS THROUGH THE WIRES AND THEN UH THE CHIP WILL SEND START CONNECTION AND KNOWS THAT WHICH BUTTON IS PRESSED
IT PROS PRODUCES A MORS MORSE CODE LINE SIGNAL SPECIFIC TO THAT BUTTON
YOU COMPLETE A SPECIFIC CONNECTION THAT MEANS WHEN YOU WHEN YOU PRESS A BUTTON THERE WILL BE A S A SMALL CIRCUIT UNDERNEATH THE BUTTON
UH WHEN YOU PRESS A BUTTON WHEN YOU DO THAT
SUPPOSE YOU HAVE PRESSED CHANNEL ONE BUTTON NUMBER ONE YOU HAVE PRESSED THEN THE UH CHIP WILL KNOW THAT THE NUMBER ONE BUTTON WAS PRESSED
LIKE YOU HAVE GOT A SIGNAL BY PRESSING A BUTTON
SUPPOSE UH THE UH USER HAS PRESSED BUTTO BUTTON ONE THEN IT WILL HAVE A SPE THE CIRCUIT WILL GENERATE A SPECIFIC MORSE CODE TO B THAT THAT BUTTON
EVERY BUTTON EVERY INDIVIDUAL BUTTON HAS ITS OWN MORSE CODE
THAT'S A D A MORSE CODE HAS BEEN GENERATED BY THE INTEGRATED CIRCUIT
AND THE TRANSISTOR WILL AMPLIFY THE SIGNAL AND SEND THEN TO THE L. E. D. WHICH TRANSLATES THE SIGNAL INTO INFRARED LIGHT
NOW THAT SIGNAL THAT MORSE CODE HAS TO BE AMPLIFIED BY THE TRANSISTOR
THAT IS THE USE OF TRANSIST TRANSISTOR WE WHICH WE USE IN THE REMOTE CONTROLLER
SO UH THIS IS HOW THE REMOTE CONTROLLER WORKS
IT WILL AMPLIFY THE SIGNAL AND IT WILL SEND IT TO THE L. E. D. AND WHICH TRANSLATES THE SIGNAL INTO AN INFRA INFRARED BITS
THE SENSOR ON THE T. V. CAN SEE THE INFRARED LIGHT AND SEEING THE SIGNAL SEEING THE SIGNAL RE IT REACTS APPROPRIATELY
THEN IT WILL DO THE APPROPRIATE ACTION
THAT WHEN IT SEES THE AMPLIFIED MO MORSE CODE SIGNAL THEN IT WILL UH IT WILL UH KNOW WHICH UH WHAT WHAT ACTION IT HAS TO UH DO
IT WORKS
CAN YOU GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE
YEAH I HAVE FEW PICTURES
AND TO THE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE UH UM REMOTE CONTROLLER UH IT'S IT'S IT THIS IS A NORMAL REMOTE CONTROLLER
MM-HMM
LIKE YOU CAN SEE A CHIP THERE WHICH IS HAVING EIGHTEEN PINS
AND ALSO A CAPAC UH A CAPACITOR THREE RESISTORS AND ALSO A RESONATOR UH UM MM YEAH AND DI AND A DIODE TRANSISTOR
AND UH IF YOU OPEN THE REMOTE CONTROLLER YOU HAVE THIS CIRCUI CIRCUIT BOARD AND FEW ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS
AND WHERE WE HAD A A FEW BUTTONS AND ALL
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
THE ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS UH ALL OF THE ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS HAVE ALL THOSE UH THINGS LIKE A CHIP AND D DIODE TRANSISTORS AN
YEAH DI UM CAN Y UH YOU CAN SEE THE T. A. DOUBLE ONE EIGHT THREE FIVE LABELLED UH CHIP UM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM YES
YES
CAN YOU GO GO ON TO THE NEXT SLIDE
UH YOU CAN ALSO SEE THE UH UH THE GREEN TWO GREEN THINGS ARE UH THESE ARE THEY ARE THEY ARE RESISTORS
AND UH JUST BESIDE THAT YOU CAN SEE A TRANSISTOR AND A UH UH CYLINDER SHAPE UH THAT ONE IS A CAPACITOR
UH AND ALSO THERE ARE UH UM RESISTORS UH SORRY THER THERE IS A DIODE
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
IT'S JUST PRINTING SOMETHING ON A BOARD
IT'S NOT EXACTLY WIRES WE ARE USING
THA THO THOSE PRINTS WILL ACTI ACT AS WIRES AND CI UH CIRCUITS
ACTUALLY UH BUILDING A CIRCUIT BO BOARD IS PRETTY PRETTY UH EASY AND ALSO IT'S A IT'S A L L INEXPENSIVE
BECAUSE UH UH WHEN YOU WHEN YOU ARE BUILDING UH SOME CIRCUITS SOME UM UH CIRCUITS AND ALSO WIRES
SO UH THIS IS THE CIRCUIT BOARD
IT'S IT'S BETTER TO GO FOR PRINTING BECAUSE UH YOU CAN BUILD THESE KIND OF K CIRCUIT BOARDS ON A ON A BULK AND IT'S JUST PRINTING
UH IT'S IT COSTS LESS THAN WHAT YOU PRINT ON A PAPER
NOTHING LIKE UH YOU KNOW YOU DON'T NEED TO USE WIRES AND ALL
THE GREEN ONE IS A CIRCUIT BOARD
MM-HMM
SO TH THAT GREEN UH THING IS A CIRCUIT BOARD
AND ALSO YOU CAN SEE UH THERE ARE B S LIKE UH UM ACCESS FOR BUTTONS LIKE WHEN YOU PRESS A BUTTON
CAN YOU GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE
YEAH UM INTEGRATED CIRCUIT
THE CIRCUIT UNDER THE BUTTON WILL BE ACTIVATED UH TH IT WILL IT WILL HE GET SOME SIGNALS FROM IT AND IT WILL UH IT WILL CH ITS CH SE SEND A SIGNAL SIGNALS TO THE
TRANSMIT
UH SO THIS IS THESE ARE THE CIRCUITS UN UNDERNEATH THE BUTTONS
UH CAN YOU SEE THE BLACK UH ROUND MARKS
THEY THEY ARE THE CIRCUITS
MM-HMM
YES
SO THAT ALSO WE CAN HAVE IN A BATTERY UH OR WE CAN USE SOLAR SELLS
AND UM LIKE UH WE HAVE UH DESIGNED UH BEFORE WE HAVE SEEN SOME UH FEW THINGS LIKE INSTEAD OFF BUTTONS WE HAVE SOME SCROLLS
UH AND A AS ENERGY SOURCE WE OFFER A BASIC BATTERY A MORE INGENIOUS UH HARD DYNAMO
UM A KINETIC PROVISION OF ENERGY MORE THAN WHAT IS THAT YOU SHAKE CASUALLY TO PROVIDE ENERGY
NEXT PLEASE
UH B BUT A B A PUSH BUTTON REQUIRES A SIMPLE CHIP UNDERNEATH IT BUT WHEREAS A SCROLL WHEEL REQUIRES NORMALLY A REGULAR CHIP WHICH IS A HIGHER PRICE RANGE
LIKE FOR S SCROLLS WE HAVE TO GO FOR A SOPHISTICATED AND AND K UH UH UH FULL A COMPLETE CHIP
UH
OKAY
OKAY
HMM THAT'S INTERESTING
YEAH
UM
UH USUALLY THE CASES AND CARD FLAT THAT W WE SEE USUALLY UH D UH A NORMAL REMOTE CONTROLLER
UH YEAH UH THE PRODUCT CAN BE DE DELIVERED INTO DIFFERENT CASES
OKAY
OKAY
AND YOU HAVE MORE PICTURES
UH WE HAVE FIVE MINUTES TO THE END OF THE MEETING
YEAH
YEAH MAYBE D UH I HAVE JUST ONE MORE SLIDE I THINK
UM
UM AND ALSO FOR ELECTRONICS WE CAN USE A SIMPLE AND REGULAR UM RE OR AN ADVANCED CHIP ON THE PRINT
UM ALSO INFRA IT INCLUDES THE INFRARED SE SENDER
LIKE WE CAN HAVE A MA MATERIAL SUCH AS PLASTIC RUBBER WOOD TITANIUM BUT TITANIUM WE CAN'T USE
UM YEAH THE UH FOR THE MOVIE JUST TO J DEVELOP UH SAMPLES AND SO SPE SAMPLE SPEAKER
AN YEAH THAT'S IT
IT'S ALL FOR ME NOW THANK YOU
OKAY WELL THANK YOU
ANY PARTICULAR COMMENTS BY ANYBODY
UH YEAH ON THE SCROLL AND THE PUSH BUTTON UM CA YOU CAN ACHIEVE SCROLLING BY REPEATEDLY PUSHING A BUTTON
NOW NOBODY USES THAT BECAUSE YOU NEED YOU NEED A A K SOPHISTICATED CHIP AND ALL
NO NO NO TH THE THE THE SCROLLING WHEELS ARE DIFFERENT LIKE YOU CAN GO FOR A SW SWITCHES LIKE BUTTONS OR SCROLLS
YEAH UH YEAH PUSH BUTTONS
SO I THINK IT'S BETTER WE GO FOR UH UM ORDINARY BUTTONS
UH WHICH WHICH WE USED TO DO BEFORE TEN TEN YEARS BEFORE I THINK
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
UM
WE'LL JUST GO FOR PUSH BUTTONS FOR IN THE INTEREST OF COST
OKAY
PUSH BUTTONS
WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME LEFT AND WE WILL STILL HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION AND THE MARKETING EXPERT HAS TO PRESENT HER HER THING
OKAY
GO RIGHT TO MY FIRST MY NEXT SLIDE
UH OKAY
THEY WANT EACH BUTTON TO DO SOMETHING
SO THAT WE HAVE A LEG UP ON TIME TO SELL IT AND PUSH IT BEFORE OTHER PEOPLE GET OUT THEIR CHRISTMAS ITEM
UM AND OUR PREFERENCE IS AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED ARE WE GOT TO GET TO THE MARKET BEFORE THE COMPETITION
AND THEY WANT UM AS FEW BUTTONS AS POSSIBLE AND THEY DON'T CARE FOR THE MODE THING
I TRY TO NOTICE WHAT KIND OF REMOTE CONTROLS PEOPLE HAVE AND IF IT'S CONVENIENT IN THE CONVERSATION I ASK ABOUT IT
AND I'VE BEEN LOOKING AROUND UM AT WHAT DESIGNS EVERY YEAR DIFFERENT THINGS ARE POPULAR
SO WE'VE GOTTA NARROW OUR SELECTION DOWN TO LI TWO THINGS I THINK THAT WE GONNA SAY ARE REALLY GREAT ABOUT OUR OUR OUR NEW PRODUCT
GO AHEAD I'M TRYING TO FINISH FAST FOR YOU
AND PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF HARD PLASTIC AND HARD METAL
AND IN MY RESEARCH THIS YEAR I FOUND OUT THAT FRUIT AND VEGETABLE SHAPES ARE REALLY POPULAR
THEY ARE MORE BACK INTO SOFT FEEL SPONGY FEELING THINGS THINGS WITH MAYBE A LITTLE CLOTH ON THEM
AND THEN WHEN I'M OUT UM IN PEOPLE'S HOUSES OR AT MEETINGS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
AND EYE CATCHING IS IMPORTANT
IT'S GOTTA LOOK CUTE IT'S GOTTA LOOK APPEALING
AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU ALL TO DO THE SAME
SIMPLE IS BEAUTIFUL
SO I'VE REALLY BEEN LOOKING AT THE PRESS AND THE ADS THAT ARE OUT THERE FOR OTHER REMOTE CONTROLLERS
SO THOSE ARE THINGS MAYBE WE WANNA LOOK AT AS FAR AS SALEABILITY OF THE ITEM
THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO SQUINT AT SMALL PRINT UM THEY WANT BUTTONS WHOSE FUNCTIONS ARE OBVIOUS
OURS HAS TO BE LOOK REALLY GREAT AND IT HAS TO COME OUT BEFORE THE OTHERS
AND WE SHOULD DEVELOP ONE OR TWO FEATURES WE CAN REALLY DWELL ON IN OUR AD CAMPAIGN
IF WE TRY TO TELL PEOPLE IT HAS TOO MANY GREAT FEATURES UM THE CONSUMER JUST GETS CONFUSED AND WE DON'T GET ANYWHERE
UM PEOPLE LIKE SOMETHING THAT REALLY FITS IN THEIR HAND
UM AND MY FINDINGS FROM THIS IS THAT YOU KNOW SMALL IS BEAUTIFUL
I S I SPEND A LOT OF TIME ON THE INTERNET UM SURFING AROUND DOING THE SAME THING
UM ALRIGHT MY METHOD IS UH I'M INTERESTED IN WHAT THE COMPETITION IS DOING AND WANNA SEE HOW WE CAN MAKE OURSELVES DIFFERENT FROM THE COMPETITION
'KAY
MM-HMM
UH THAT
OKAY
AND WHAT WE REALLY HAVE TO DECIDE IN THIS MEETING IS UM THE CONCEPT OF THE REMOTE
CONCLUDES THE PRESENTATION OF EVERYONE
MM-HMM
AND UH SO WHAT DO WE THINK ON THE CONCEPT
OF THE REMOTE
YOU WANNA TRY TO COME BACK TO YOURS AND LIMIT YOURS A BIT
UH YES I WOULD LIKE TO INCLUDE THIS FEATURE WHICH IS CALLED AS VOICE RECOGNISER
Y
MM-HMM
OKAY
OKAY
MM-HMM
SO SPEECH RECOGNITION IS MOST IMPORTANT AS FAR AS YOU'RE CONCERNED
YEAH BUT W
THIS COULD BE UH ONE FEATURE WHICH COULD BE SELLABLE
THAT THAT BE REALLY GOOD YEAH I AGREE WITH THAT
YEAH H THAT COULD THAT COULD THAT COULD BE OUR STAR FEATURE
YEAH
I THINK THAT'S
BECAUSE A SPEECH RECOGNISER LIKE I IT IT HAS ITS OWN UH UH PROBLEMS ISSUES
YEAH BUT BUT I WHAT I'M UH VERY VERY MUCH DOUBTFUL HOW HOW UH FAR IT WILL WORK
MM-HMM
DISTANCE PROBLEM
YEAH IT'S NOT DISTANCE PROBLEM IT IT'S RECOGNISING A PERSON'S VOICE
LIKE MAYBE DIFFERENT PEOPLE WILL BE HAVING DIFFERENT VOICES SO IT LIKE IT'S UH EVERYTHING SO I
MM-HMM
UH
WELL YOU YOU TEACH YOU HAVE TO TEACH UH
SO TO GET A GOOD RECOGNI RECOGNISING SYSTEM IT'S A COSTLY THING I THINK
UH GOOD MORNING LIKE AROUND EIGHT O'CLOCK I WANT TO SEE THE NEWS IN THE TELEVISION
NO IT'S IT'S UH YEAH IT IT'S LIKE YOUR RECORDING OF UH ALL UH UM A QUESTION ALREADY
SO I'LL SAY JUST GOOD MORNING AND THE T. V. WILL SWITCH ON
IT WILL RECOGNISE MY VOICE AND WILL SWITCH ON
I'M THE USER AND MY FAMILY MEMBERS ARE THE USER I WILL ALREADY RECORD UH A QUESTION LIKE
AND THEN YOU'RE EXPECTING AN ANSWER FROM TH FOR EXAMPLE YOU HAVE A T. V. SYSTEM
MM-HMM
YEAH BUT YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
OKAY BEFORE WE GET TOO FAR OFF HERE UM THE COMPONENTS OF THE CONCEPT IS THE ENERGY
WHAT KIND OF ENERGY DO WE FORESEE
THAT THAT'S THAT'S GONNA BE MOST COST EFFECTIVE AND THE BEST THING
I THINK I THINK BATTERY AND I THINK WE ALL AGREED ON THAT
BATTERY
BATTERY
BATTERY
YES
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY THEN CHIP ON PRINT
YEAH
YEP
YES
OKAY
AND THE CASE
AND I THINK WE ALL AGREE ON THE CASE WE WANNA HAVE SOMETHING UH MAYBE BRIGHT COLOURFUL
YEAH
BRIGHT COLOURFUL TRENDY TRENDY DESIGN AND STRONG
AND COMPACT
AND ALSO STRONG
TRENDY YEAH
TRENDY DESIGN AND COMPACT
MM-HMM
TRENDY DESIGN COMPACT AND STRONG
MM-HMM
YES
USER INTERFACE CONCEPT UH INTERFACE TYPE SUPPLEMENTS
THAT WILL BE YOUR AREA I THINK RIGHT JANA
UH
UM LIKE THE SWITCHES LIKE WE USE BUTTONS FOR USER INTERFACE
PUSH BUTTONS
PUT UH K I GUESS UH FOR YEAH
PUSH BUTTONS
AND
NOT SURE WHAT THEY MEAN BY SUPPLEMENTS
AND
YEAH
WELL I THINK THAT
SUPPLEMENTS LIKE DIFFERENT TYPES OF FEATURES BUTTONS LIKE CAN HAVE A F MUTE BUTTON OR A SWAPPING BUTTON
YEAH OR OR LIKE HER SPEECH RECOGNITION WOULD ALSO BE A SUPPLEMENT
HER SPEECH RECOGNITION FEATURE WOULD BE A SUPPLEMENT
OH LIKE
OH
RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT MM-HMM
A WHAT
RECOGNISER
YES
MM YEAH
OKAY SO WHY DON'T WE PUT DOWN SPEECH RECOGNITION IF POSSIBLE PENDING SOME MORE RESEARCH FROM OUR INDUSTRIAL ENGINEER ON HOW EXPENSIVE THAT IS
HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
RIGHT
YES
UH OUR NEXT MEETING WILL BE IN THIRTY MINUTES
OKAY
AND THE UH I. D. IS TO THIS IS THE INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS TO BE TAKEN UNTIL THEN TO HAVE THE LOOK AND FEEL DESIGN
AND UH THE U. I. D. IS SUPPOSED TO UH COME UP WITH THE USER INTERFACE DESIGN
MM-HMM
IN THIS PHASE THE TWO OF YOU JANA AND FRANCINE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER ON A PROTOTYPE USING MODELLING CLAY IT SAYS HERE
AND THE MARKETING EXPERT WITH THE PRODUCT EVALUATION
YOU WILL RECEIVE SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS WILL BE SENT TO YOU BY YOUR COACHES
OKAY
OKAY
MM-HMM
OKAY
UM IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS YOU KNOW YOU YOU CAN ALWAYS UH CONTACT ME UM OR UH OR YOUR COACH I SUPPOSE
WHEREVER THEY'RE HIDING
UM SO UM I THINK WE CONCLUDE THE MEETING HERE AND WE COME BACK IN UH UH THIRTY MINUTES ACCORDING TO OUR TIMETABLE HERE
YEAH
OKAY
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THANK YOU
THANK YOU
WELL HI EVERYONE AGAIN
HELLO
HELLO
HELLO
UM LIKE BEFORE WE UH I HAVE TO REDO THE MEETINGS FROM N TH THE MINUTES FROM THE LAST MEETING AND SO HERE WE GO
MM-HMM
UH IT WAS DISCUSSED IN THE LAST MEETING UH WHICH WAS OPENED BY THE PRESENTATION FROM THE INTERFACE UM
DESIGNER
IT SHOULD HAVE NINE CHANNEL BUTTONS A NEXT BUTTON VOLUME BUTTONS SUBTITLE BUTTONS SWITCH TO CONTROL FEATURES COLOUR CONTRAST SHARPNESS ETCETERA
DESIGNER THAT UH LOOKS WOULD BE VERY IMPORTANT ON THIS NEW REMOTE AND UM IT IS TO SEND MESSAGES OF COURSE TO THE T. V.
IT SHOULD HAVE A MEMORY SWITCH A MUTE BUTTON IN CASE THE TELEPHONE RINGS OR SOMETHING
UM
UH SPEECH RECOGNITION IS ONE OF HER VERY F FAVOURITE PERSONAL UH FEATURES SHE WOULD LIKE SEE D D TO BE INTEGRATED IN THIS UM IN THIS NEW REMOTE
UM SHE UH PRESENTED ALSO AN OVERSIZED REMOTE WHICH SHE GUARANTEES NOBODY WILL EVER BE ABLE TO LOSE
SHOULD BE CHILD FRIENDLY DESIGN WITH FEW BUTTONS COLOURFUL MAYBE WITH S STAR SHAPED OR OTHER SHAPED BUTTONS
UM
AND SHE WAS CHALLENGED ON THAT POINT
THAT'S RIGHT
YES
SHE WOULD LIKE A SPECIAL CASE MADE OUT OF PLASTIC THAT IS VERY STRONG NOT USING ANY HARMFUL MATERIALS SHOULD BE RECYCLABLE AND SHOULD BE COLOURFUL
THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER UM PRESENTED HER UH THOUGHTS ON THE ISSUE
BUT UH HER VERY F PERSONAL FAVOURITE REALLY SHE SHE WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO SEE A SPEECH RECOGNISER INTEGRATED IN THIS REMOTE
SHOULD HAVE AN INTEGRATED CIRCUIT BOARD THAT'S HIGHLY SOPHISTICATED AND TEMPERATURE RESISTANT
UH TECHNICALLY THIS THING WOULD ALSO HAVE A RESISTOR AND A CAPACITOR DIODE TRANSISTOR RESONATOR AND IF POSSIBLE A RECHARGEABLE BATTERY
SHE WOULD LIKE TO SEE A TIMER AND OR ALARM FACILITY INTEGRATED
UH AND OF COURSE A CIRCUIT BOARD
THE CHIP IS MORSE MORSE CODE RELATED RELAYS THE UH TO THE GENERAT TO THE GENERATOR AMPLIFICATION AND UH THE CIRCUIT BOARD IS VERY INEXPENSIVE TO BUILD AND SO SHE THINKS THIS IS A GREAT FEATURE UH TO TO TO CONSIDER
AND HOW IT WOULD WORKS YOU PRESS THE BUTTON
OKAY
SHE WOULD LIKE UH THIS WHOLE THING SHOULD BE PUSH BUTTONS WITH A SIMPLE CHIP
UH SCROLLING METHOD IS MORE EXPENSIVE AND NOT THAT PRACTICAL ANYMORE
SHOULD BE BATTERY OPERATED AND OF COURSE SHE WOULD HAVE THE SPECIAL CASES
HAS DONE SOME RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET AND ALSO HAS USED H HER PERSONAL OBSERVATIONS TO COME UP WITH THE FACT THAT SUCH A REMOTE SH SHOULD BE SMALL
THE MARKETING EXPERT UH WHO HAS TO FINALLY COME UP WITH TO TO TO MARKET THIS PRODUCT HAS BEEN WATCHING THE COMPETITION
EASY TO USE AND IT SHOULD BE EYE CATCHING
FROM HER POINT OF VIEW OF COURSE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTS IS THAT WE SHOULD GET TO MARKET BEFORE OUR COMPETITION DOES
TO DO THAT UH MAYBE ONE OR TWO FEATURES SHOULD BE DEVELOPED ON WHICH WE COULD DWELL ON OR IN OTHER WORDS ON WHICH OUR CAMPAIGN COULD BE BUILT ON
SO WE PREFER TO HAVE ONE OR TWO FEATURES THAT CAN BE REALLY UH DRIVEN HOME
TOO MANY NEW FEATURES OR TOO MANY POINTS WOULD ONLY CONFUSE MATTER
UM IT SHOULD HAVE A FRUIT AND VEGETABLE DESIGN AND SHOULD HAVE A SOFT FEEL
SHE FEELS THAT'S REALLY WHAT PEOPLE WANT TODAY
AND THE DECISION THAT WE TOOK LAST TIME WAS THAT UH THE SPECIAL FEATURE WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE IS A SPEECH RECOGNISER
THE ENERGY SHOULD BE BATTERY UH SHOULD BE ON A CHIP SHOULD BE TRENDY DESIGN COMPACT AND STRONG AND SHOULD HAVE BUTTONS
AND THAT CONCLUDES THE PRESENTATION FROM THE LAST MINUTES FROM THE LAST MEETING
NOW UH WE ARE READY FOR THE PRESENTATION OF THE PROTOTYPE
YEAH
JUST THE LOOK LIKE THE BUTTON PART I'LL EXPLAIN
YEAH
YEAH
THIS IS A MODEL OF THE REMOTE CONTROL WHICH WE ARE GOING TO BUILD
UH SO THIS IS OUR WHAT UH WE HAVE MADE
UH AND ALSO COMPACT IN SHAPE
UH THIS IS US IN A SNAIL SHAPE SO UH IT IT IS ATTRACTIVE UM AND IT'S IT'S BLUE IN COLOUR UH BRIGHT AND UH IT HAS YELLOW BUTTONS AND ALL THE DIFFERENT COLOUR BUTTONS SO IT IS A UH UH A LOOKS WISE IT IS BEAUTIFUL
UH UM AND ALSO I IT IT WILL BE EASILY FIT INTO INTO THE HANDS AND YOU CAN ACCESS ALL THE BUTTONS EASILY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
GOOD
YEAH OOPS SORRY
YOU USED TO HAVE ALL THE BUTTONS
UM YEAH AND UM UH THE MATERIAL WHICH WE ARE GOING TO USE FOR THE CASE IS UH PLASTIC AND UH W WHICH WHICH IS S STRONG UM UH AND ALSO UH FOR THE
UM THE MATERIAL IS PLASTIC AND UH FOR THE BUTTONS IT IS UH S SOFT RUBBER UM AND ALS YEAH
YEAH BECAUSE UH UH YOU'LL BE TOUCHING THE BUTTONS MORE SO IT IS SOFT WHEN YOU TOUCH IT
OH THAT'S GOOD NO THAT'S NICE AND FRIENDLY
MM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM MM-HMM
MM-HMM
AND THEN UM UH FOR THE FOR THE LED
FOR THE LIGHT EMITTING DIODE IT IS A FLUORESCENT GREEN AND IT'S A A IT IS A BULB LIKE AN ORDINARY INFRARED
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
AND AND THE BUTTON BUTTON'S PART UH WILL BE EXPLAINED BY F FRANCINA
NOW THE UM WE DECIDED UPON INCLUDING CERTAIN FEATURES ON OUR REMOTE
NOW THESE FEATURES INCLUDES THE S UM SIGNAL EMITTING UH SIGNAL IT'S THE LED OR L. E. D. THE INFRARED
OKAY
NOW UH WE HAVE INCLUDED THE SWITCH ON AND OFF BUTTON
OKAY
YEAH OKAY MM-HMM
MM-HMM MM-HMM
MM-HMM
NOW WE HAVE INCLUDED ANOTHER FEATURE THAT IS THE MUTE BUTTON
MM-HMM
THEN WE HAVE INCLUDED ONE TO NINE BUTTONS
ON THE SIDE OF THE MODEL
MM-HMM
FOR CONTROLLING THE PROGRAMMES THE DIFFERENT CHANNELS
MM-HMM
WE HAVE ALSO INCLUDED TWO BUTTONS FOR INCREASING OR DECREASING THE VOLUME
MM-HMM
AND WE HAVE ALSO INCLUDED TWO BUTTONS FOR SCROLLING UP AND SCROLLING DOWN THE PROGRAMME CHANNELS
MM
NOW OUR OUR MODEL ALSO CONTAINS A BUTTON WHICH IS CALLED AS THE MENU BUTTON
WHAT KIND OF BUTTON
MENU BUTTON
UH MENU TH MENU UH ONE ONE
MENU
YES MENU
MENU BUTTON
AT THE CENTRE
MM-HMM
WE HAVE INCLUDED A BUTTON WHICH IS FLUORESCENT GREEN COLOUR AND THIS IS THE MENU BUTTON WHICH WILL CONTROL THE COLOUR SHARPNESS BRIGHTNESS
MM-HMM
OF THE SCREEN
MM MM-HMM
OF THIS UH PICTURE
WE HAVE ALSO INCLUDED A BUTTON WHICH IS CALLED AS THE SWAPPING BUTTON
NOW THIS BUTTON
NOW THIS IS UH A SPECIAL SPECIAL FEATURE WHICH WE HAVE INCLUDED
IS AN ELONGATED SHAPED BUTTON AND THIS IS SLIGHTLY FLEXIBLE SO IF IT IS TURNED TOWARDS THE RIGHT IT WILL TAKE TO THE PREVIOUS CHANNEL
IF IT IS TURNED TOWARDS THE RIGHT IT WILL TAKE TO THE NEXT CHANNEL
IT WILL TAKE THE USER TO THE PREVIOUS AND THE NEXT CHANNEL SO THIS IS A
SWAPPING BUTTON
THE NEXT CHANNEL IN THE NUMERIC PATTERN OR
YES
NO
SWAPPING IS IF IF EXAMPLE YOU'RE YOU'RE WATCHING THE SECOND CHANNEL AND THEN YOU GO TO THE TENTH CHANNEL AND IF YOU WANT TO GO BACK TO THE SECOND CHANNEL YOU CAN SWAP
THIS BUTTON
YEAH MM-HMM
MM
OKAY OKAY
AND AT THE END IT THIS REMOTE HAS INBUILT VOICE RECOGNISER WHICH C WHICH WILL RECOGNISE THE USER'S VOICE AND THEN IT'LL ACT ACCORDINGLY
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
SO THIS IS OUR PROPOSED MODEL
NOW THE MARKETING EXPERT HAS TO
OKAY
MM-HMM
TELL YEAH
GIVE HER SUGGESTION WHETHER IT'LL BE SELLABLE OR IT'LL BE COST EFFECTIVE
OKAY WELL UM
THAT YOU CAN REALLY HOLD IT IN ONE H YOU DON'T NEED TWO HANDS AND IT'S EASILY REACHABLE EVEN FOR SOMEBODY WITH A SMALL HAND YEAH
WHAT WHAT I REALLY LIKE A LOT ABOUT IT IS THAT YOU CAN REACH THE WHOLE THING WITH ONE THUMB
YES YES
MM-HMM
YES THE BUTTONS ARE ALL RAISED RIGHT
YOU REALLY DID A GOOD JOB ON THAT MY LITTLE DESIGNERS
TURN IT UPSIDE DOWN MOVE IT UP UP AND DOWN I REALLY LIKE THAT
THAT'S THAT'S A REALLY GOOD GOOD THING
UM AND UM I LIKE THE IDEA THAT THE ON OFF BUTTON IS IN A REALLY PROMINENT PLACE
THE BUTTONS ARE ALL RAISED AND IF YOU HOLD IT IN THE CENTRE OF YOUR HAND YOU CAN EVEN REACH IT OVER HERE SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO TURN IT AROUND
YES
ARE RAISED MM-HMM
RIGHT
OR HAVE TWO HANDS TO OPERATE IT YEAH
MM
MM-HMM
YES AND IT SORT OF STICKS UP SO THAT YOU REALLY YOU DON'T HAVE TO G FIRST GO LIKE OH YEAH HERE IT'S ON AND YEAH MM-HMM
YEAH THAT'S GREAT
HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
ABS OKAY
THE COLOUR'S VERY ATTRACTIVE
UM THE UM THESE BUTTONS UH AROUND HERE ARE THE MUTE
NO THESE THE FRONT BUTTONS WHICH ARE HERE ARE THE MUTE BUTTONS
YES YES
AND THESE MM-HMM
ON BOTH SIDES THEY'RE MUTE
OKAY
SO YOU CAN PUSH EITHER ONE
YES
SO IF YOU'RE LEFT HANDED OR RIGHT HANDED IT DOESN'T MATTER
AND THIS BRINGS THE MENU UP ON THE SCREEN
THIS BRINGS THE MENU UP ON THE SCREEN AND THE ORANGE ONES ARE
PARDON ME
THIS IS THE MENU YES YES
A THE THE THESE THESE TWO ARE TH TO INCREASE OR DECREASE THE VOLUMES AND THESE TWO ARE TO UH SCROLL THE PROGRAMME CHANNELS
OKAY
RIGHT VERY GOOD
F F OKAY
SCROLL UP OR SCROLL DOWN THE CHANNELS
UH IT LOOKS MM LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING I CAN SELL
OKAY AND NOW I'M SUPPOSED TO YEAH
WELL I HAVE ONE QUESTION UH WILL THERE BE ANYTHING WRITTEN ON THE BUTTONS
LIKE THAT PEOPLE KNOW OR THEY HAVE TO LEARN THAT FROM A PIECE OF PAPER WHICH BUTTON DOES WHAT
YES IT WILL HAVE UH THESE BUTTONS WILL HAVE THE NUMBERS AND ALL THE REST OF THE BUTTONS WILL HAVE SYMBOLS
YES WHICH CAN BE EASILY RECOGNISED
AH
YEAH DEFINITELY
WILL HAVE SYMBOLS SO THAT THAT THAT THE USER REALLY KNOWS YOU KNOW AND DOESN'T HAVE TO FIRST LEARN IT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YES
YEAH
GOOD POINT BECAUSE WE NEED THE SYMBOLS 'CAUSE WE'RE GOING INTO AN INTERNATIONAL MARKET WE CAN'T HAVE ANYTHING THAT'S LANGUAGE DEPENDENT
YES
YEAH OF COURSE AND ALSO
YES
HMM
YEAH
BUT ANYWAY IT WOULD HA I I I IT HAS TO HAVE SOME KIND OF OF SYMBOLS TEXT OR SOMETHING SO THAT PEOPLE KN
YEAH
YES

YEAH
YES
THAT'S RIGHT
MM-HMM
OKAY YEAH JUST WANTED MAKE SURE OF THAT MM-HMM
AND
A SHELL SHAPE
AND ONE MORE FEATURE IS WE WE HAVE A HOLDER FOR THIS REMOTE WHICH IS AN OYSTER SHAPE
MM 'KAY MM
MM-HMM
SO
WELL YOU KNOW I THINK WE COULD DO SOMETHING REALLY FUNNY WITH THIS TOO BECAUSE THE SNAIL IS KNOWN TO BE SLOW AND WE COULD HAVE SOME SORT OF LITTLE COMIC EFFECT ON OUR MARKETING ABOUT HOW THIS IS A RAPID SNAIL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU KNOW THAT WOULD
FOR THE SNAIL YEAH MM-HMM WE HAVE THE SNAIL SHELL
HE GOES RIGHT BACK INTO HIS SHELL
THAT WOULD REALLY WORK
RIGHT MM-HMM
YES YES
YEAH
SO IT IS YEAH YEAH SHELL
YES SNAIL SHELL
MM-HMM
YES
RIGHT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM
Y YES
YEAH OF COURSE YEAH
NOW WHAT WHAT ARE OUR SPECIAL FEATURES FOR THE MARKETING
THAT'S REALLY THE VOICE RECOGNITION THAT'S REALLY UNUSUAL
I THINK VOICE RECOGNITION IS OUR BIG SELLING POINT 'CAUSE NOBODY ELSE SEEMS TO HAVE THAT IN IN THIS PRICE RANGE
MM-HMM
MM
MM
AND THEN AND THEN THE OTHER THING WOULD BASICALLY BE SH SHAPE OR PRACTICALITY OF USE
I THINK WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO DWELL ON ON ON THE APPEARANCE
WE'RE REALLY GONNA HAVE THE BE THE
YEP UH WELL I THINK THAT EVERYBODY'S GONNA SAY THEIR REMOTE CONTROL IS PRACTICAL
YOU KNOW
COLOURS
MM-HMM
CUTEST
I THINK THOSE ARE THE TWO THINGS TO PUSH
SO I THINK WE HAVE TO PLAY WITH THE IMAGE PLAY WITH THE SNAIL IMAGE UM PLAY WITH THE VISUAL AND THEN THE VOICE RECOGNITION
CUTEST REMOTE CONTROL ON THE BLOCK
THE LOOK
MM
YEAH
MM-HMM
THEY'RE GONNA BE OUR TWO SELLING POINTS
AND THE VOICE RECOGNITION
OKAY NOW UH HAVING SAID THAT
I'M SUPPOSED TO MAKE A LITTLE PRESENTATION AREN'T I
NO NOW THIS WAS OUR EVALUATION CRITERIA WHICH WE UH JUST HAVE DONE
NOW WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT FINANCING
OKAY
AH BUT IN MY INSTRUCTIONS I THINK IT SAID I WAS SUPPOSED TO GO TO THE BOARD AND DO SOMETHING
NO
WELL THERE IS A PRODUCTION EVALUATION
IS THAT YOU
YEAH THAT'S ME
SEE
BUT THAT'S AFTER THE FINANCING
FI SEE
SORRY SORRY
OH OKAY
MM MM
UM
OKAY WE HAD LOOKS AND VOICE RECOGNITION
OKAY UH ENERGY SOURCE WE SAY THAT'S BATTERY RIGHT
OKAY NOW ON THE FINANCING WE BRING UP THE MM THERE IT IS
MM
THAT'S RIGHT
OKAY NOW
SO WE I GUESS WE USE ONE
YEAH
YES
WHAT
T CELL OR CHART YOU ARE TRYING TO CHANGE IS PROTECTED
WELL THAT'S NICE
SHE TOLD ME I COULD JUST CH CHANGE IT HERE AND THEN IT WOULD
IT DOESN'T WORK
HMM
CAN YOU JUST FILL IT IN IN THE YELLOW BOXES
OR
OH OKAY YEAH OKAY LET'S SEE
ONE OF THOSE
OH GO AWAY
OKAY ONE OKAY
UM KINETIC SOURCE SO THAT'S IN THE ENERGY SOURCE THAT'S ALL WE NEED
UH ELECTRONICS SIMPLE CHIP ON PRINT
IS THAT'S WHAT WE'RE USING
YEAH
YES
MM-HMM
YEAH YEAH
YES
NO
UH REGULAR CHIP ON PRINT
OKAY ONE
COME ON
NO
THAT'S ALL WE NEED THE ONE CASE UNCURVED FLAT SINGLE CURVED DOUBLE CURVED
YEAH
WELL
THIS IS A
SINGLE CURVE
MM
I GUESS IT'S DOUBLE CURVED
DOUBLE CURVED
ONE OF THOSE
MM-HMM
PLASTIC WE SAID RIGHT
CASE MATERI S SUPPLEMENTS
YEAH
PLASTIC
UH WOOD RUBBER
RUBBER BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA HAVE THE SOFT BUTTONS
YEAH
UH BUT YES BUT
I THINK UH THAT IS UH F FOR RUBBERS THAT IS UH YEAH CASE MATERIAL
THAT'S JUST FOR THE CASE MATERIAL SO SPECIAL COLOURS THOUGH WE HAVING THAT RIGHT
IS THIS FOR THE CASE
YES
OH OKAY THE MM-HMM MM' KAY
MM-HMM
YES
MM-HMM
AND THEN WE HAVE TO INTERFACE PUSH BUTTONS

MM-HMM
SCROLL WHEEL NO

MM
EIGHT EIGHT POINT TWO
NINE POINTS OKAY YES

WELL WITHIN BUDGET
YEAH
MM-HMM
OKAY
OKAY
I GUESS I SHOULD SAVE THIS I SUPPOSE HUH

OKAY FINE
OKAY GOOD SO THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS
WE GONNA BE POPULAR
UM
MM-HMM
YEAH
SO THAT UH I THINK FINANCING WAS PRETTY SIMPLE
MM-HMM
NOW WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A PRESENTATION BY THE MARKETING EXPERT ON PRODUCTION EVALUATION
OKAY I'LL TAKE MY FILE DOWN SO YOU CAN BRING IT UP
'KAY SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET IT NOW
'KAY WHY DON'T YOU MOVE JUST TO THE NEXT SLIDE RIGHT AWAY
OKAY
YOU WANNA GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE
WE THINK IT'S GOOD WE'RE GONNA GET BEHIND IT AND SELL IT
UM NEXT SLIDE PLEASE
OKAY WELL UH OBVIOUSLY MY METHOD FOR UH S M THE MARKETING OF THIS THING IS FIRST TO ASK THE BIG QUESTION WILL IT SELL
WE DON'T S WANT SOMEBODY TO SUDDENLY COME TO US AND TELL US THAT THIS BUTTON IS TOXIC AND YOU KNOW SOME CHILD WILL SWALLOW IT AND THEN WE WON'T SELL ANY
WE CAN'T ACCEPT EVERY SUGGESTION OF COURSE BUT MAYBE WE JUST NEED TO GET A FEW
AND THEN AFTER THAT WE JUST HAVE TO GO WITH OUR BEST INTUITION AND YOU KNOW WE LIKE IT
AND SHOW THE THE PROTOTYPE TO CONSUMER RESEARCH GROUPS
AND I THINK WE SHOULD SHOW THIS PROTOTYPE TO PEOPLE FROM VARIOUS AGE AND SOCIO ECONOMIC GROUPS AND SEE ABOUT ANY FINE TUNING THAT MAYBE LITTLE THINGS WE HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF
SO WE HAVE TO GET SOME INPUT FROM THOSE PEOPLE
YEAH RIGHT AWAY
OKAY
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM
MM-HMM
THE SIZE IS SMALL THE COLOUR'S BRIGHT AND WARM WHICH IS WHAT WE WANTED
WE WANTED THE FEEL TO BE AS SOFT AS POSSIBLE WE'LL HAVE THE SOFT BUTTONS AND THE WAY THIS IS SHAPED
I WANTED IT TO BE COMFY AND ROUNDY SO WE WE'VE GOT THAT
SO PARADOXICALLY THE OTHER FEATURES IN OTHER WORDS THE LOOK THE FEEL UM AND THE SHAPE THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE GONNA GET IN THE STORE
EVEN THOUGH IT'S GONNA BE HARD PLASTIC IT FEELS GOOD IN YOUR HAND SO THAT'S NICE
AND FUNCTIONALITY I PUT LAST ON MY LIST BECAUSE PEOPLE AREN'T GOING TO USE IT BEFORE THEY BUY IT
OKAY NOW THE THINGS THAT I WAS THINKING AND TH MY WISH LIST HAS REALLY BEEN REALISED IN THIS PROTOTYPE
I WANTED THE SHAPE TO BE BIOMORPHIC I DIDN'T WANT ANYTHING WITH ANGLES AND ALL SQUARE
THEY DON'T HAVE A TELEVISION IN THE STORE THEY CAN'T PLAY WITH IT
MM-HMM
FEE SELLING
YEAH
YEAH
YES
I THINK THAT IT'S I THINK THAT IT'S PLENTY SMALL ENOUGH TO SELL BUT I THINK WE'RE SORT OF RIGHT THE SCALE IS ONE TO SEVEN
SO UM TH THOSE HAVE BEEN FULFILLED BY YOUR PROTOTYPE AND GO AHEAD TO THE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE
I THINK WE'RE SORT OF RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE AS FAR AS C OTHER COMPETITORS
THE SIZE IS SMALL UM AND TH THESE POINTS ARE IN THE IMPORTANCE FOR THE FOR THE MARKETING THESE AREN'T I IN HOW I FEEL
OKAY SO UM THE SHAPE UM I THINK IS A A ONE
THAT'S REALLY REALLY EXCELLENT SHAPE
UM SO THEY'LL BE OUR MAIN SELLING POINTS
OKAY
SO I THINK THAT BASICALLY WE'VE GOT A GREAT PRODUCT AND WE CAN GET OFF AND RUNNING WITH IT
AND GIVEN UM THE CONSTRAINTS THAT WE HAD I THINK WE GOT IT AS SOFT AS POSSIBLE
OBVIOUSLY WE COULD HAVE AD ADDED DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS BUT THEN WE'D DISTURB SOMETHING ELSE SO I WOULD SAY THAT WE GOT TO A FIVE OUT OF SEVEN ON ON FUNCTIONALITY
AND THEN FUNCTIONALITY UM I THINK YOU DID A REALLY GOOD JOB ON FUNCTIONALITY
THE COLOURS ARE BRIGHT AND WARM AND WE REALLY DO GREAT JOB THERE
AND OUR COLOUR I THINK IS GREAT
OKAY
MM-HMM
YEAH
UM I JUST REALISED ONE THING
IN THE FINANCING THERE WAS NO ROOM FOR OUR VOICE RECOGNISER
YES
YES
AH
YEAH
AND UH I DON'T KNOW HOW WE CAN EVALUATE THAT OR HOW WE CAN INCLUDE THAT TOO
WELL UM WE HAD WHAT EIGHT EIGHT EUROS TWENTY AS OUR COST
EIGHT EIGHT TWENTY YES
EIGHT TWENTY SO
AND SO WE'VE GOT WE'VE STILL GOT FOUR EUROS TO GO TO SPEND
WE HAVE UM FOUR EUROS YEAH
I MEAN MAXIMUM WE HAVE ANOTHER FOUR POINT THREE EUROS I MEAN FOUR THIRTY
MM-HMM
WELL UM THAT'S
AS A FINISHED PRODUCT AND SAYING OKAY WITH THE VOICE RECOGNISER THAT COSTS SO MUCH
BUT I MEAN WE HAVE NO WAY OF PRESENTING THAT TO MANAGEMENT AS YOU KNOW AS A F FINISHED
MM-HMM
SO UM WE JUST HAVE TO BEWARE OF THAT
I MEAN AND KNOW WHETHER THE FOUR THIRTY WILL REALLY COVER THAT
YEAH
AND UM IT MAY NOT BE THE GREATEST QUALITY BUT IT MAY SELL ANYWAY
SO WE'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO SETTLE FOR WHATEVER QUALITY THAT WILL BUY US
AS WE'VE SEEN WITH SO MANY OF THESE KINDS OF PRODUCTS
WELL AS WE KNOW IN TODAY'S TECHNIC TECHNOLOGICAL WORLD YOU CAN DO JUST ABOUT ANYTHING AT ANY PRICE THE THE THE PROBLEM IS QUALITY
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YES YES
YEAH STILL
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT THEN BUT I JUST UH RECOG I JUST REMEMBERED THAT THERE WAS NO THAT THAT WAS NOT UM INCLUDED UH THAT THERE WAS NO ROOM FOR ANY SPECIAL FEATURES
YOU WANNA GO TO THIS NEXT SLIDE MARKETING EXPERT
SO TO BEWARE OF THAT
INCLUDED YEAH
HMM-HMM

I THINK THAT WAS MY LAST SLIDE YEAH
GO AHEAD

MM OKAY
UM AND WE'RE SUPPOSED TO TALK ABOUT THOSE THINGS AS A TEAM NOW SO IF YOU PUT MY LAST SLIDE BACK UP THERE
AND I'M SUPPOSED TO PRESENT THIS SCALE ON THE WHITEBOARD
OH
I'M SORRY I'VE UM FORGOT TO DO THAT UM
WHY
WH WHY YOU NEED THAT UP
HMM
WELL BECAUSE I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT I PUT ON THERE
OKAY
NOW I'M SUPPOSED TO SEE HOW LONG MY LEASH IS HERE
I THINK YOU CAN MAKE IT THERE
MM 'KAY
UM OKAY SO ON SHAPE
SO NOW WE'RE ALL SUPPOSED TO SAY WHAT WE THINK
YOU READY
I GAVE IT A ONE
WAIT WHAT WOULD YOU RA UH ONE BEING GOOD AND SEVEN BEING THE WORST
ONE OKAY AND BE BETSY
UM WHAT DO YOU THINK THE SHAPE IS
WORSE OKAY
ONE
YES I THINK UH SHAPE IS ONE
YEAH EVEN MY YEAH SHAPE IS ONE
OKAY UH-HUH ONE OKAY
AND HOW ABOUT ON SIZE
ON SIZE
YOU YOU GAVE IT A FOUR
I GAVE IT A FOUR YEAH I FEEL IT'S JUST AVERAGE
UM I DUNNO
I THINK I WOULD GIVE IT AT LEAST A TWO
OKAY
ONE
MM-HMM
YEAH EVEN I THINK IT IS ONE
IT'S QUITE SMALL
UM AND THEN HOW ABOUT HOW WE DOING ON COLOUR
OKAY YOU'RE THE DESIGNER OF COURSE YOU WANNA GIVE IT A ONE
OKAY
COLOUR UH I
COLOUR I GAVE IT A ONE
I REALLY LIKE ALL THOSE NICE BRIGHT WARM COLOURS
ONE
ONE
I I LIKE THE COLOURS
YES
ONE
ONE
YEAH ONE
ONE ONE ONE OKAY
AND HOW ABOUT THE FEEL
TAKING INTO UM CONSIDERATION TEXTURE AND COMFORT IN THE HAND
UH I THINK I WOULD GIVE IT A TWO
OKAY I GAVE IT A THREE TWO YEAH
THREE
I'LL GIVE THREE
UH MAYBE TWO YEAH
TWO OKAY
AND THE NEXT IS FUNCTIONALITY WHERE I I ADMIT I WAS A LITTLE HARD ON OUR TEAM HERE BUT
WELL IT'S ALSO YOU CAN'T REALLY TRY IT OUT UH THE OTHER THINGS YOU HAVE HAVE MORE IS ARE MORE TANGIBLE SO FROM THAT POINT OF VIEW BUT UM
YEAH
MM-HMM
I'LL GIVE IT A THREE
OKAY
TWO
TWO OKAY
UH THREE MM-HMM
THREE
OKAY
WELL UM
BUT UM OTHERWISE I THINK WE'RE WE'RE READY TO GO TO GO WITH THIS PRODUCT
IT LOOKS LIKE WE'VE GOT GOT OURSELVES A PRETTY GOOD PRODUCT
UM THE FUNCTIONALITY'S THE ONLY PLACE WHERE MAYBE WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT M M MAYBE HEAVEN FORBID HAVING ANOTHER MEETING
YEAH
ANYBODY ELSE HAVE ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR ANY OTHER THINGS THAT WE FEEL WE SHOULD EVALUATE
UH
HERE IS WHAT WE LOOKING AT UH SATISFACTION ON FOR EXAMPLE ROOM FOR CREATIVITY
UM
IS THERE MORE ROOM FOR CREATIVITY OR ARE WE ABSOLUTELY HAPPY
MAYBE WE CAN
WE CAN ALWAYS IMPROVE YES
WE CAN MAKE THE BUTTONS FEW BUTTONS SMALLER
UH I THINK THEY ARE QUITE BIG SO I THINK I I MEAN WE CAN JUST HAVE SMALL BUTTONS AND MORE BUTTONS IN THAT CASE
YEAH INCLUDE SOME MORE BUTTONS AND UH UM YEAH FEATURES
IF WE WANT TO HAVE MORE FEATURES THAN THAT
YES FEATURES
MM-HMM
SO THAT THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO MAYBE WE CAN ELIMINATE ONE OF THE MUTE BUTTONS INSTEAD OF HAVING TWO MUTE BUTTONS
AND UM THEN MAYBE WE CAN DO SOMETHING WITH THE UM
WELL THEN AGAIN IF WE'RE GONNA UM DO THE SPEECH RECOGNITION THING WE'RE GON THERE GONNA BE SOME BUTTONS THAT ARE GONNA HAVE TO BE ADDED FOR THAT FOR THE RECORDING OF THE THE SPEECH
YEAH
YEAH DEFINITELY
YES
VOICES
MM-HMM
YEAH DEFINITELY YEAH TWO MU MUTE BUTTONS
YES
YES
MAYBE WE CAN PUT THAT ALL ON ONE BUTTON
THE VOLUME CONTROL
HMM
UM AND A COUPLE OF OTHER TH MAYBE COMP UH CONSOLIDATE SOME OF THE USAGE AN AND SEE WHAT WE CAN DO WITH THAT
MM-HMM
Y UM AL ALWAYS BEARING IN MIND THAT RIGHT NOW WE ARE OF COURSE WELL WITHIN THE BUDGET AND THAT WE STILL YOU KNOW WE PROBABLY CAN'T
UH UM WE NEED UH YOU KNOW WE NEED TO LEAVE SPACE MONEY WISE FOR THE VOICE RECOGNISER
WITH THIS PARTICULAR ITEM WE PROBABLY CAN'T JUST UH ADD A WHOLE LOT OF MORE THINGS
AND MAYBE
MM-HMM
NO
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YES
UM
MM-HMM
UH UM ARE WE HAPPY WITH THE CREATIVITY THAT HAS PASSED HERE OR WE'RE NOT HAPPY WITH THE NEW PRODUCT WE CREATED OR THAT WAS CREATED
SO TH THE QUESTION REALLY IS HOW DO WE FEEL WITH THE PROJECT PROCESS
UH I THINK PERSONALLY I THINK UH I'M PRETTY HAPPY
YEAH
I'M PRETTY HAPPY WITH IT TOO YEAH UM IT'S SOMETHING I THINK I CAN MARKET
EVEN I'M HAPPY
UM AN
YEAH
UH
AND THEN THE NEXT QUESTION IS ARE WE HAPPY WITH THE LEADERSHIP OF THIS PROJECT
I THINK YOU'VE DONE A GOOD JOB MISS LEADER
YES YES YOU'VE DONE A GOOD JOB
YEAH YEAH DEFINITELY
AND I THINK TEAM WORK I THINK WAS VERY VERY GOOD I THINK WE REALLY YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH I D I DO TOO I THINK WE WORKED WELL TOGETHER AS A TEAM YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
WE USED WHITEBOARD WE DIDN'T USE DIGITAL P WELL DIGITAL PENS I GUESS ARE THESE THINGS
AND UH I THINK WE ARE WE HAPPY WITH THE MEANS WE USED
YEAH MAYBE WE COULD'VE USED THE WHITEBOARD A LITTLE BIT MORE YEAH WE DIDN'T USE THAT ENOUGH
WHITEBOARD MORE YES YES
YEAH PROBABLY
UH
IT'S MAYBE NOT IN THE BEST POSITION IN THE ROOM UM YOU KNOW LIKE SOMETIMES IT'S POSITIONED SO THAT IT'S MUCH BETTER VISIBLE FOR EVERYBODY AND I THINK FROM THAT POINT OF VIEW WE SORT OF IGNORED IT A LITTLE BIT
YES WE COULD
MM-HMM
AND WE USED THE SLIDE BECAUSE IT WAS BETTER POSITIONED
YES
I THINK WE DID
YES I THINK SO I THINK ABSOLUTELY AND FORTUNATELY WE ALL HAD SLIDES PRESENTATION WHICH MADE IT A LITTLE EASIER
UM DID WE NEW DID WE FIND NEW IDEAS
YEAH
NO
MM I THINK THAT'S TRUE MM-HMM
HMM
YES
MM-HMM
YEAH MANY
I THINK WE WERE WE WERE VERY GOOD YEAH MM
I THINK WE WE DID UH IN MORE THAN ONE RESPECT AND UH SO I THINK WE DID VERY WELL HERE
MM-HMM
OKAY
UM THEN CELEBRATION
ARE THE COSTS WITHIN BUDGET
YES YES
UH IS THE PROJECT EVALUATED
YES
YES YES
YEAH
TODAY WE HAVE APPLE JUICE AND AFTER WE SELL M MILLION OF 'EM WE HAVE CHAMPAGNE
CELEBRATION
CEL CELEBRATION YES YES
AH
SO I I THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH
UM I THINK THIS WAS VERY GOOD AND UM
MM-HMM
YEAH
I THINK WE DID COME UP WITH A NEW PRODUCT THAT'S UH FEASIBLE
FEASIBLE FROM THE PRODUCTION POINT OF VIEW AND FEASIBLE FROM A MARKETING POINT OF VIEW
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
SO THANK YOU
OKAY
YEAH
THANK YOU
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
OKAY
WATCH I I HAVE MY CORD BEHIND YOU HERE
OKAY
OKAY
I ALWAYS GET IT ON HERE BUT GETTING IT OFF IS
DO WE DO WE HAVE SOME TIME LEFT
UH YOU HAVE
THEY SAY IT'S FORTY MINUTES
AH YES WE HAVE TIME LATER BUT WE DON'T
BUT WE WE WERE TOLD WE COULD END THE FINAL MEETING AT ANY TIME WHENEVER WE FELT WE WERE FINISHED
OKAY
OH ALRIGHT
IT'LL TAKE ME THE REST OF THE TIME TO GET MY MICROPHONE OUT FROM MY NECKLACE
OH THERE WE GO
YEAH
SO UH GOOD MORNING
I SEE YOU ALL FIND YOUR PLACES
IS EVERYBODY SITTING ON THE RIGHT PLACE
SO
I GUESS SO
MORNING
MORNING
MORNING
YEP
LET'S SEE
FIRST I WILL INTRODUCE MYSELF
WELCOME
HELLO
BART
BART
I DON'T KNOW IF UH IF EVERYBODY KNOWS ME SO I'M BART HELLO
HELLO
HELLO
MY NAME'S FRANK
I'M
THANK YOU
UH LET'S SEE
UH LET'S START OFF UM WITH A LITTLE PRESENTATION
UH
THERE ARE SOME NOTES IN IT ALREADY I SEE SOME DOCUMENTS
SO IS THERE A PROJECT DOCUMENTS FOLDER
THEY'LL RECORD UH OUR ACTIONS AND YOU'LL HAVE WIRES AND MICROPHONES THAT WILL RECORD YOUR VOICE
UH I'LL START WITH THE PRESENTATION KICK OFF
NOW FIRST I'LL TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE SETTING
YOU CAN SEE THERE ARE A FEW CAMERAS HERE
UH THERE ARE ALSO SOME MICROPHONES THERE BUT TH UM YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY A LOT OF ATTENTION ON THOSE
BECAUSE IT WILL UH DISAPPEAR WHEN YOU DON'T ATTEND TO IT
IS BEING MODIFIED BY THE ADMINISTRATOR
LET'S DO IT READ ONLY
UH OKAY
HMM THAT'S INTERESTING
I'M BART THE PROJECT MANAGER SO I'LL DIRECT YOU THROUGH THE PROJECT
WELL I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE NOTICED BUT UH WE'RE WORKING FOR REAL REACTION
UH IT'S A COMPANY IN UH ELECTRONICS
WE PUT FASHION IN ELECTRONICS UH WE MAKE IT WORK UH WE PUT A LOT OF EFFORT IN DESIGN AND IN THE PRODUCT ITSELF
THIS IS OUR AGENDA
UH WE HAVE OUR OPENING ACQUAINTANCE TOOL TRAINING PROJECT PLAN DESCRIPTION CLOSING
UH MAYBE I CAN SIT DOWN THEN I CAN TAKE SOME NOTES OR LET'S SEE
UH AS YOU CAN SEE UH IT'S THE OPENING AQUAINTANCE TOOL TRAINING
YEAH
NO
I DUNNO IT'S NOT A LOT OF WORK BUT JUST UH IF YOU HEAR SOMETHING UH YOU CAN WRITE DOWN JUST WRITE IT DOWN
AQUAINTANCE IS A POINT WE'VE DONE A BIT
I THINK I FOUND ONE
HAVE YOU SEEN ANY FLAWS IN IT
MAYBE YOU CAN TAKE THE MINUTES ONCE IN A WHILE
UM HAVE YOU ALL SEEN THE CORPORATE WEBSITE ALREADY
SURE
VISIT IT
YEP
YEP
HMM
CAN'T SAY I PAID MUCH ATTENTION TO IT BUT
I CAN
SO THESE ARE UH THE POINTS WHY UH WE ALSO HIRED YOU
OKAY NO PROBLEM
NO IT DOESN'T WORK HERE
BUT UM ON THE CORPORATE INFORMATION SIDE THERE'S A TH UH THERE WAS REAL REMOTE INSTEAD OF REAL REACTION
UH OUR PROJECT AIM IS AS YOU CAN SEE A NEW REMOTE CONTROL
SEE IF IT WORKS THIS WAY
UM OKAY WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO
AND INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER UH THERE'S ALSO USER FRIENDLY AND A BIT ORIGINAL
REAL REMOTE IS NOT REALLY THE COMPANY WE'RE WE ARE BUT IT'S JUST A LITTLE FAULT
WE'VE GOT THE MARKETING EXPERT FOR UH THE TRENDY AND USER FRIENDLY LOOK
IT HAS TO BE ORIGINAL TRENDY AND USER FRIENDLY
OH YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
OKAY
AND WE'VE GOT OUR USER INTERFACE DESIGNER
HE'S ALSO UH
YEP
THAT'S ABOUT THE NEW REMOTE CONTROL
FIRST IS FUNCTIONAL DES UH DESIGN INDIVIDUAL WORK MEETINGS
AFTER THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN THEN THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN AND THE DETAILED DESIGN
UH PROJECT METHOD UM IS UH THERE ARE THREE PHASES WE ARE GOING THROUGH
I HAD SOME ROLE INDICATIONS ON HERE
THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER IS GOING TO WORK ON THE WORKING DESIGN UH COMPONENTS DESIGN AND A BIT OF THE LOOK AND FEEL DESIGN
BUT THAT WILL BE ALL WORKED OUT IN UH OTHER MEETINGS
UH THE USER INTERFACE DESIGNER IS GOING TO DO THE TECHNICAL FUNCTION DESIGN USER INTERFACE CONCEPT AND USER INTERFACE DESIGN
AND THE MARKETING EXPERT IS DOING A LITTLE BIT OF USER REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATION TREND WATCHING AND PROJECT UH PRODUCT EV EVALUATION
SO THAT'S A BIT WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO
BUT I THINK YOU KNOW IT ALREADY BY YOURSELF
THEN WE'VE GOT OUR FIRST TOOL TRAINING
YOU CAN SAVE
AS YOU CAN SEE WE'VE GOT THE SMART BOARDS HERE AND HERE IN THE WHITE BOARD
WE ARE GOING TO WORK WITH A LOT OF HIGH TECH TOOLS HERE SO IT'S AB IT'S HANDY IF WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF TRAINING FIRST
UM IN THE WHITE BOARD HERE THERE'S A LITTLE TOOL BAR ON THIS SIDE
HERE ARE SOME FUNCTIONS
N UH THESE FUNCTIONS WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH ONLY UNDO YOU CAN UNDO A LITTLE
CAPTURE WE DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING WITH
SO OKAY
BUT THEN FIRST YOU HAVE TO SELECT THE PEN FUNCTION
A BLANK NEW DOCUMENT FOR EACH PERSON
IT'S REALLY FUNNY BECAUSE YOU CAN DRAW WITH IT ON THIS PAGE UM IN THE THINK IT IS FORM OF
YOU CAN ALSO SELECT THE CURRENT COLOUR AND THE LINE WIDTH
UH THAT'S VERY SIMPLE AND IT'S EASY TO UH DRAW YOUR FINDINGS AND DRAWINGS ON THERE
UH SELECT A PEN ERASER
UH PIECE OF DRAWING
UH THEN WE'VE GOT OUR PEN
THIS PEN
BUT WE'RE GOING TO WORK WITH IT IN A MINUTE
'KAY
HMM
UH THEN
A SHORT THING ABOUT DOCUMENTS
BUT ALL YOU WILL FOUND THAT ALREADY BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF DOCUMENTS IN IT ALREADY SO IT WILL BE OKAY
PROJECT DOCUMENTS I THINK
WE'VE GOT OUR SHARED FOLDER UH PROJECT PROJECT WHAT WAS IT
AND THESE ARE AVAILABLE ON THE SMART BOARDS AS WELL SO IF YOU HAVE A DOCUMENT YOU WANNA SHOW JUST OPEN IT FROM THE FOLDER
OKAY
YEAH
IT'S WHAT I JUST SAID IT'S SAVE PRINT MOVE BACK OR FORWARD ONE PAGE
YOU CAN SWITCH BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT DRAWINGS
HERE IS A SIMPLE TOOL BAR
AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO TRY OUT THE WHITE BOARD
MOUSE WASN'T RUNNING AWAY
JUST TO UH UH JUST TO GET A BIT FAMILIAR WITH IT
SO AS YOU CAN SEE WE G ALL GOING TO DRAW A ANIMAL
THAT WAS INTERESTING
WE'RE GOING TO UH DRAW ANIMAL
OKAY
NO
IS EVERYBODY IS ANYBODY PLAYING WITH THE MOUSE
INNOCENT
UH THERE'S I CAN START FROM NOW
AND UH JUST SUM UP A FEW OF ITS FAVOURITE CHARACTERISTICS
UM THE ONLY THING WE HAVE TO UH LOOK AFTER IS THAT WE USE DIFFERENT COLOURS AND DIFFERENT LINE WIDTH
BECAUSE IF YOU HOLD IT LIKE THIS THE SENSORS WILL GET BLOCKED AND THEN THE DRAWING WON'T GET GOOD
I WILL
YOU CAN USE THIS PEN BY HOLDING IT LIKE A LIKE A LITTLE CHILD
OKAY
'KAY
ANOTHER THING IS YOU HAVE TO BE UH A BIT SLOW
THESE ARE NOT VERY MUCH BUT UH
'CAUSE IF YOU'RE GOING TO DRAW LIKE REALLY FAST THEN UM THE PEN WON'T HOLD UP
THEN THE LINE WIDTH
SO WE CHOOSE FORM OF CURRENT COLOUR UH I THINK GREY IS APPROPRIATE
I THINK SEVEN WILL BE NICE
NOW YOU'LL SEE MY DRAWING CAPABILITIES
UH SEE YOU HAVE TO DO IT REAL SLOW
OH
SURE
AH I WAS TRYING TO DRAW A DOLPHIN BUT I THINK HIS NOSE HAS TO BE A LITTLE BIT BUT IT'S CLOSE
I'M THINKING ABOUT A SWORDFISH
YEAH HE HASN'T GOT AN EYE
SO WHAT YEAH IT'S THIS IS BIT OF THE SWORDFISH
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
AND THEN YOU CAN UNDO
WE'VE GOT THE ERASER
WOAH
NOW WE'VE GOT ANOTHER FUNCTION
THIS EASILY
MEAT
AND I'VE GOT TO WRITE DOWN A FEW OF ITS CHARACTERISTICS
UH IS
AH IT'S OKAY
THEY'VE GOT NO TEXT TOOL NO
UH
OKAY
THIS IS TYPICALLY A UNDO ACTION I THINK
PEN
YEAH
MAYBE YOU HAVE TO HOLD IT A BIT
UPSIDE DOWN
BUT I DON'T KNOW I'M JUST TRYING
I THINK THAT'S IT BECAUSE IF YOU WAN AR ARE GOING TO DO IT LIKE THIS THEN IT WILL BE A STRIPE
MAYBE YOU HAVE TO USE
THIS IS NOT MY WORK OKAY
HMM
OH
I THINK IT'S A IT WANTS TO DRAW A ANOTHER ANIMAL
UH
I DON'T KNOW
IT LIVES FOR THE FUN
SO
SO NOW I'M GONNA HAND OVER THE PEN ON THE NEW BLANK SHEET TO YOU
GO AHEAD
IT'S MY CHARACTERISTIC UH CHARACTERISTIC ABOUT THE DOLPHIN
IT LIVES FOR THE FUN
OKAY
OKAY
THANK YOU
OKAY
GONNA USE A DIFFERENT LINE WIDTH
AND I'M GONNA DRAW IN BLACK
'KAY I'M NOT MUCH OF AN ARTIST BUT HERE WE GO
THERE
MAYBE IT'S EASIER TO DRAW THE SMALLER LINE WIDTH I THINK
BECAUSE THIS IS GOING A LOT BETTER THAN UH I DID
HMM
A SHEEP
MM
OKAY
THIS IS MY UM HMM
SHEEP
IT'S NICE
WITH OF COURSE
LITTLE BLUE DOT THEY ALWAYS GET SPRAYED ON THEIR BUTTS
UH
IT'S A REAL DEAD SHEEP YEAH
FOR RECOGNITION YEAH I SEE
THERE
YEAH
ON JUST A
UM MAYBE YOU CAN ALSO WRITE YOUR NAME SOMEWHERE
'KAY
THEY ARE
COME ON
YOU HAVE TO GO REALLY SLOW WHEN YOU'RE WRITING
YEAH
THEY'RE BRILLIANT ANIMAL ANIMALS
AND THAT'S JUST A LITTLE ME THINGY
SO
GUESS I'LL PASS THE PEN TO OUR USER INTERFACE DESIGNER
UM I'M JUST GONNA DRAW ITS UH HEAD BUT MM
OKAY
NICE
LET'S SEE
MM
UH
OKAY
SWEET
INTERESTING
YEAH
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS
OR WHO
A RABBIT
GARFIELD
YEAH
GARFIELD
AH OKAY YEAH
JUST A
GUESS
MM
SO UH
THAT'S ENOUGH
YEAH
UM YOU SAY A BLANK OR
YEAH JUST A BLANK SHEET
OKAY
SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN GARFIELD
WELL I WAS GONNA DRAW A CAT TOO SO
I'LL JUST TRY SOMETHING ELSE
NO
MINE IS A BIT MORE SKINNY
YEAH IT'S PRETTY SKINNY CAT
YEAH
BUT UH
AND THE MOST INTERESTING TAIL
IS YOUR CAT OR DID YOU FIND HIM ON THE STREET
WELL IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A CAT
I LIKE CATS BECAUSE UH
THEY ARE UH
INDEPENDENT
AH
THE PEN
SO
OKAY
SO IF YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS OR IF YOU WANNA DRAW ANYTHING ON THE WHITE BOARD JUST ASK AND GO AHEAD
SO EVERYBODY KNOWS HOW TO WORK WITH THE WHITE BOARD NOW
THAT'S PRETTY CLEAR
IT'S PRETTY UH EASY
YEAH
THE PEN
SO WE'VE GOT THE TOOL UH INTRODUCTION
S HAUNTED WHITE BOARD
'KAY
WE
WE'RE BEING HAUNTED
UH WE CAN DO IT INTERNATIONAL SO WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON DIFFERENT KIND OF USERS DIFFERENT KIND OF CULTURES AND DIFFERENT KIND OF TRENDS AS WELL
UM AS YOU CAN SEE WE UM FOR OUR REMOTE CONTROL A SELLING PRICE IS UH TWENTY FIVE EUROS
MOVE ALONG TO THE PROJECT FINANCE
UM BUT THAT'S ALL IN THE LATER STADIUM
UH OUR PROFIT AIM IS FIFTY MILLION EUROS
UH THAT'S THE LEAST WE HAVE TO GET FROM OUR REMOTE CONTROLS SO WE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER TO REACH OUR AIMS
OUR SELLING PRICE
SELLING PRICE TWENTY FIVE PROFIT AIMS FIFTY MILLION UM BUT MORE IMPORTANT IS THE INT INTERNATIONAL MARKET WE'RE TRYING TO FOCUS ON
AND PRODUCTION COST UH MAXIMAL TWELVE AND A HALF EUROS
SO JUST TRY TO REMEMBER THESE POINTS
OUR PRODUCTION COST UM CAN BE MAXIMAL TWELVE AND A HALF EUROS
SO THAT'S ALSO A POINT WE HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND THAT WE WON'T MAKE REMOTE CONTROLS WITH SMALL TELEVISIONS INSIDE AND STUFF LIKE THAT
IT WON'T WORK
IT'S EASIER
FIVE MINUTES
SO I'M GONNA SIT DOWN I THINK
I'VE GOT A MESSAGE
WE'VE GOT ABOUT FIVE OR TEN MINUTES LEFT FOR DISCUSSION
OKAY THAT'S UH GOOD TIMING
SO THAT'S LEADS US TO OUR LITTLE DISCUSSION
YEAH YOU GOT A MESSAGE
FIVE MINUTES OKAY
SO JUST ON A SIDE NOTE WHY IS IT MY LAPTOP IS ONLY GIVING ME A BLACK SCREEN
MM
UH MAYBE YOU HAVE TO SAY THE MAGIC WORD
YEAH
RIGHT
DOES IT DO ANYTHING
NO
MAYBE YOU HAVE TO JUST CLAP IT DOWN
MM BACK UP AGAIN
NO SLIDE SHOW
HMM
IT'S OFF NOW
YOU'LL BE OKAY I THINK
NOW YOU HAVE TO PUT IT BACK O OH YEAH
IT'S OFF
WELL IT WAS ON BUT
WELL IT'S THOSE LAPTOPS
AH THERE WE ARE
NO
LIKE YOU CAN USE FOR OTHER
BUT SO MM DOES EVERYBODY HAS UM EXPERIENCES WITH UH REMOTE CONTROLS AND I MEAN NOT THE ORDINARY MOTE CONTROLS BUT ALSO A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT ONES
OKAY
NICE
YOU
MM
OH REALLY
HUH
WELL WE HAVE A
NO ME NEITHER
IT'S A
AND I THINK IT'S IT WOULD BE BEST TO JUST MAKE ONE REMOTE CONTROL THAT CAN OPERATE THEM ALL
ONE FOR THE T. V. ONE FOR THE VIDEO RECORDER ONE FOR THE D. V. D. PLAYER
KIND OF BROAD T. V. AT HOME AND A D. V. D. PLAYER SO WE GOT LIKE A LOT OF REMOTE CONTROLS
AH YEAH
YEP
AND YOU CAN UH PROGRAM I THINK EIGHT DIFFERENT DEVICES IN IT AND YOU CAN USE IT FOR YOUR TELEVISION ANYTHING ELSE
SO THAT'S PRETTY HANDY WHEN YOU HAVE A VIDEO RECORDER OR D. V. D. PLAYER DOWNSTAIRS AND YOU'VE GOT A LINK TO YOUR T. V. ON THE SECOND FLOOR
SO THAT'S A PRETTY HANDY UM
YEAH I'VE I'VE GOT ONE AT HOME
AND IT ALSO OPERATES ON INFRA RED SO YOU HAVE TO GOT THE LITTLE DEVICE INSIDE YOUR ROOM
AND THEN YOU CAN OPERATE IT FROM THE THIRD OR TH OR SECOND FLOOR
SURE
YEAH
OKAY YEAH
YEAH
OKAY YEAH
OH REALLY
HMM
OH
YEAH
MM-HMM
THING
UM BUT ONLY THE
I THINK THAT IF YOU CAN PUT DIFFERENT KIND OF DEVICES IN ONE REMOTE CONTROL IT MAKES IT A LOT EASIER AS WELL
IT'S UH
YEAH
OH
THAT'S GOOD TO REMEMBER
SO I THINK YOU CAN TAKE MINUTES AGAIN
SO WE'VE WE WANT DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS
YEAH THAT'S NICE I THINK
SINCE IT'S YOUR JOB
YEAH
BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WILL EXCEED THE PRODUCTION COSTS
UH AND WE CAN MAYBE SEE IF WE CAN DO SOMETHING WITH THE INFRA RED
SO THAT UH THAT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE TO FIND OUT I THINK
MM
YEAH
BUT THAT WOULD BE REALLY GOOD IF WE COULD DO THAT
AND OTHER FUNCTIONS FOR A REMOTE CONTROL
MAYBE WE CAN MAKE IT UH UH
UM
MM-HMM
THINK IT HAS TO BE SHOCK PROOF
SURE YEAH
'CAUSE
SHOCK PROOF
MY REMOTE CONTROL TENDS TO FALL A LOT
WATERPROOF OR UH
SURE
SO
UH YOU NEVER NO KNOW UH I W I MEAN UH
WATERPROOF
SO THESE ARE OUR UM A FEW THINGS WE CAN THINK OF
OKAY
UM I WILL PUT THE MINUTES FROM THIS MEETING UH IN OUR PROJECT FOLDER
'KAY
YEAH ONE OTHER LITTLE THING
THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE HANDY TO PUT A BATTERY STATUS DISPLAY ON IT
SO YOU CAN SEE
THAT'S A BATTERY STAYS
OKAY YEAH
HOW MUCH IS LEFT IN THE BATTERY
BUT THEY'LL ALSO REALLY DRAG UP THE PRODUCTION COSTS SO THINK WE'LL HAVE TO SEE ABOUT THAT TOO
YEAH
MM
UH
BUT MAYBE JUST A LITTLE LED I DON'T KNOW
THAT'S AN IDEA AS WELL
OTHER IDEAS
QUICK IDEAS
THEY WERE ALL MENTIONED SO
NOPE
MM
OKAY
ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS UH PRESENTATION
KICK OFF PRESENTATION
YEAH
UM
NOPE DON'T THINK SO
NO
OKAY THEN I'LL PUT THE MINUTES FROM THIS MEETING IN THE PROJECT FOLDER
AND THEN WE CAN ALL WORK
AND WE CAN ALL WORK UH ON OUR OWN PROJECTS
FINISH MEETING NOW
OKAY
OKAY
AYE SIR
SO GOOD LUCK
OKAY THEN I'LL MEET YOU IN ABOUT A HALF AN HOUR I THINK
HALF AN HOUR
OKAY
OKAY
YEP
OKAY
THAT'S NICE
EVERYBODY FOUND HIS PLACE AGAIN
OKAY
AND UH STILL FAILING
OKAY SO THIS IS OUR SECOND MEETING
YEAH
YES
YEAH
UM IMPORTANT THING OF THIS PHASE IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO UH TRY TO GET AN AGREEMENT ABOUT THE USER REQUIREMENTS TECHNICAL FUNCTION DESIGN AND THE WORKING DESIGN
UH NOW WE'RE GOING UM INTO THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN
BUT FIRST THIS PHASE
THERE'S A LITTLE ADAPTATION IN THE AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM
SO THAT WE CAN MOVE ONTO THE SECOND UH PHASE
UM FIRST AN ANNOUNCEMENT
SO
THERE'S OUR GHOST MOUSE AGAIN
THAT THAT MEANS THAT YOU CAN HAVE A LITTLE TROUBLE WITH LITTLE TROUBLE WITH THE AIR CONDITIONING THAT'S BECAUSE OF THIS UH
OKAY
OKAY
SO IT SHOULD BE OVER IN A IN A WHILE COUPLE OF DAYS
NOW FIRST THE OPENING
IT'S IN WING C. AND E.
THEN OUR AGENDA
BUT IT'S GOING TO BE COLD ANYWAY SO I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GONNA NEED IT
UH THIS TIME I WILL TAKE THE MINUTES
NO
SO UH I SUGGEST WE TAKE ABOUT SEVEN MINUTES PER PRESENTATION
AND THEN WE CAN HAVE A LITTLE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENTS UH WHICH HAVE BEEN SENT TO ME
UM AND WE'VE GOT FORTY MINUTES FOR THE WHOLE UH PRESE FOR THE WHOLE UH PRESENTATIONS
UH YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A PRESENTATION
ALL OF YOU
SO WE'VE GOT FORTY MINUTES FOR ALL OF IT
UM WHO WANTS TO BE FIRST
SO I SUGGEST UM LET'S START WITH THE FIRST PRESENTATION
AND THEN THE DECISION ON THE CONTROL FUNCTIONS UH WHICH WE WANNA INCLUDE AND THOSE WHICH WE DON'T WANNA INCLUDE
YES
THINK I'LL GO FIRST
OKAY
SO
JUST MAYBE IT'S EASIER IF YOU UM YEAH I THINK YOU WILL TELL YOUR PRESENTATION AS WELL
JUST WHICH FUNCTION YOU HAVE AND WHAT YOU'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT
BUT YOU ALREADY KNEW THAT
I'M THE MARKET EXPERT
'KAY
MY NAME IS FREEK VAN PONNEN
UM I'VE DONE SOME RESEARCH
UH WE LET THEM FILL OUT A QUESTIONNAIRE
WE HAD ONE HUNDRED OF THESE UH TEST SUBJECTS
WE HAVE WE UH HAVE BEEN DOING RESEARCH IN A USABILITY LAB WHERE WE OBSERVED UM USERS OPERATING REMOTE CONTROLS
WHAT AGES ARE INVOLVED
UH SEE WHAT THE MARKET CONSISTS OF
UH IN ADDITION WE DID SOME MARKET RESEARCH
WELL THESE ARE THREE QUITE ASTONISHING RESULTS I THOUGHT
F UH SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE UM
UM REMOTES ARE BEING CONSIDERED UGLY
UM AND AN ADDITIONAL EIGHTY PERCENT INDICATED THAT THEY WOULD SPEND MORE MONEY ON A FANCY LOOKING REMOTE CONTROL
SO
PEOPLE QUESTIONED UH INDICATED THAT THEY THOUGHT THEIR REMOTE WERE WAS UGLY
UM IN ADDITION REMOTES WERE NOT VERY FUNCTIONAL
FIFTY PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE INDICATED THEY ONLY LOO USED ABOUT TEN PERCENT OF THE BUTTONS ON A REMOTE CONTROL
AND FIFTY PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE INDICATED THAT THEIR REMOTE TENDED TO GET LOST IN THEIR ROOM
SO
MM
SOME THINGS
CHANNEL SELECTION AND VOLUME SELECTION UM BOTH GOT A TEN ON A SCALE OF ONE TO TEN FOR RELEVANCY
SO THESE ARE THE MOST
THE POWER BUTTON GOT A NINE
THEN WE DID SOME RESEARCH TO THE MOST RELEVANT FUNCTIONS
AND TELETEXT GOT A SIX AND A HALF
THAT UH AUDIO SETTINGS VIDEO SETTINGS AND CHANNEL SETTINGS BUTTONS
MOST UH IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS ON A REMOTE CONTROL
THAT'S WHAT I LIKE TO CALL THEM
THEN THERE ARE SOME ONE TIME USE FUNCTION
WHICH ARE NOT REALLY USED VERY FREQUENTLY BUT ARE STILL CONSIDERED TO BE OF SOME IMPORTANCE
UM CHANNEL SELECTION WAS ALSO INDICATED TO BE USED VERY FREQUENTLY
ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT TIMES PER HOUR
THEN THESE ARE THE THIS IS THE MARKET
UM SIXTY PERCENT OF THE MARKET CONSISTS OF USERS BETWEEN THE AGES SIXTEEN AND FORTY F SIX
UM
THEY WON'T SPEND THEIR MONEY VERY EASILY
SO
UM THEY LIKE TO USE NEW F NEW FUNCTIONS
BUT THEY ALSO ARE VERY CRITICAL
MAIN CHARACTERISTIC OF THIS GROUP IS THAT THEY'RE VERY CRITICAL ON THE REMOTE CONTROL
UM THE USERS OF FORTY SIX TO SIXTY FIVE YEARS CONS THE MAKE UP FORTY PERCENT OF THE MARKET
BUT THEY DO TEND TO SPEND THEIR MONEY A LOT EASIER
THEY ARE NOT REALLY VERY INTERESTED IN FEATURES
UM
WHAT I THINK THIS INDICATES FOR OUR UM
DESIGN
I THINK WE SHOULD MAKE A REMOTE FOR THE FUTURE
AND THIS MEANS WE WOULD
UM HAVE TO FOCUS ON THE AGE AGES SIXTEEN TO FORTY FIVE
UH THIS ALSO MAKES UP MOST THE BIGGEST PART OF THE MARKET SO THAT WILL ALSO BE WHERE OUR MAIN PROFIT WOULD BE GETTABLE
UM THIS WOULD MEAN WE WOULD HAVE TO MAKE A FANCY DESIGN
UM
THE RESULTS ALSO INDICATED THAT UM ABOUT ONE QUARTER OF THE PEOPLE QUESTIONED THOUGHT THAT THE REMOTE CONTROL CAUSED R. S. R. S. I.
BESIDES OF COURSE THAT THE REMOTE MUST LOOK VERY NICE
SO THESE ARE TWO FACTORS THAT I THINK SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE DESIGN
AND THIRTY FOUR PERCENT THOUGHT THAT IT WAS HARD TO LEARN A N HOW TO OPERATE A NEW CONTROL REMOTE CONTROL
UM THIS IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT
AND THE FUNCTIONALITY
AS A LOT OF PEOPLE INDICATED THEY ONLY USE ABOUT TEN PERCENT OF THE BUTTONS I THINK WE SHOULD MAKE VERY FEW BUTTONS
UH THIS WILL ALSO BE UH BENEFICIAL TO THE DESIGN OF THE REMOTE
'CAUSE THEY'RE USED MOST AND SO THEY SHOULD BE ROBUST
THEY SHOULDN'T BREAK DOWN EASILY
ESPECIALLY THE CHANNEL SELECTION AND AUDIO UH SELECTION BUTTONS
UH I THINK THE MOST FREQUENTLY USED BUTTONS SHOULD BE EMPHASISED
UM
THEN AS MO AS A LOT OF PEOPLE INDICATED THAT THEIR UM REMOTE GOT LOST IN THE ROOM IT MIGHT BE
BUT IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA TO MAKE A DOCKING STATION
AND THIS WOULD COULD GET A BUTTON IN IT WHICH WOULD SEND A SIGNAL TO THE REMOTE WHICH WOULD THEN BEEP
AND I SAY MIGHT BE BECAUSE IT WOULD UM CERTAINLY BOOST THE UH PRODUCTION COSTS A LOT
AND IN ADDITION TO THIS IT COULD UM RECHARGE THE BATTERIES IN THE REMOTE IF YOU PUT IT IN
SO YOU'D KNOW WHERE IT IS IN THE ROOM
THIS WAS UM
THEN UM A SURPRISINGLY GREAT DEAL OF PEOPLE W INDICATED THAT UM AN L. C. D. SCREEN IN THE REMOTE CONTROL WOULD BE PREFERRED
BUT UP TILL FORTY FIVE IT REMAINS FEASIBLE
MOSTLY PEOPLE IN THE AGE OF SIXTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE
THIS WOULD ALSO GREATLY INCREASE THE PRODUCTION COSTS BUT I THINK THESE ARE JUST SOME SMALL FACTORS WE COULD CONSIDER
OKAY
THAT WOULD BE ALL
SO ANYBODY HAVE UM ANY QUESTIONS UNTIL NOW
THANK YOU
ANY QUESTIONS
MM-HMM
ABOUT FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
OKAY THAT'S CLEAR
NO
NOW TO THE SECOND
'KAY
UH OKAY
UM F FOR THE TECHNO F FUNCTIONS UH OF OF IT
UM I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT UH THE USER INTERFACE OF IT
UM
YEAH
YEAH YOU CAN TAKE YOUR TIME
WE'VE GOT UH PLENTY OF TIME SO
OKAY
MM
OH YEAH
SLIDE SHOW
YEAH YOU SHOULD GO TO THE TOP THINGY
OH
UH
THERE IT IS
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
UH UH I'VE DO I'VE UH DONE A LITTLE UH RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET AND NOT MUCH INFORMATION ABOUT IT UM ABOUT UH INTERFACE BUT UH UH
I THINK UH WE UH MUST USE THE GENERAL FUNCTIONS UH OF THE UH REMOTE CONTROL
UM YEAH
UH SO UH YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF DEVI UH DEVICES LIKE UH D. V. D. UH UH TELEVISION UH STEREO
SO UM
YEAH I I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT A SIMPLE MANNER UH TO PUT A LOT OF FUNCTIONS UH UH IN ONE UM IN ONE UH REMOTE CONTROL
SO UM UH YOU C YOU CAN'T PUT A A LOT OF UH FUNCTIONS UH IN ONE UH YEAH
BUT UH IT MUST BE UH USER FRIENDLY
BUT UM
IN ONE UM REMOTE CONTROL
UH UH UH YEAH
ONE REMOTE
YEAH
UM YEAH
GOT UH MANY FUNCTIONS IN ONE UH REMOTE CONTROL UM BUT UM YEAH YOU CAN SEE THIS IS UH QUITE SIMPLE UH REMOTE CONTROL
UM FEW UH BUTTONS BUT UH THIS UH RE UH REMOTE CONTROL GOT A A LOT OF UH BUTTONS
UM UH PEOPLE UH DON'T LIKE IT UH SO UM
WELL WHAT UH I WAS UH THINKING ABOUT WAS UM UH KEEP THE GENERAL FUNCTIONS UH LIKE THEY ARE
UH KEEP IT UH YEAH L LIKE A RED BUTTON
UH EVERYBODY EVERYBODY KNOWS IT SO UH UH YOU DON'T HAVE TO CHANGE THAT
UM
SO UH LIKE UH THE ON OFF UH BUTTON
USE A DISPLAY FOR UH SPECIFIC UH FUNCTIONS OF THE DIFFERENT UH DEVICE
SO UM
MY PERSONAL UH PREFERENCES UM
WH WHAT I WAS TH UH THINKING ABOUT WAS UM YOU'VE GOT UM
UH THIS THE REMOTE CONTROL UH AND UH YOU GOT HERE THE GENERAL FUNCTIONS
UH LIKE UH THE ON OFF BUTTON UH SOUND UH I DUNNO UM AND UM HERE YOU'VE GOT A S KIND OF A DISPLAY
AND UM YOU GOT HERE UH REAL BUTTONS FOR UH SELECTING UH A DEVICE
IT'S A TOUCHSCREEN
SO UM YEAH YOU GOT A GENERAL F UH F THE FUNCTIONS OF THE DEVICE UH FOR A D. V. D. PLAYER OR UH SO UM THE PL YEAH UM F FOR UH PLAYING UH REVERSE UH
UM YEAH AND
SO UM THIS BUTTON IS FOR A D. V. D. OR SO UM FOR EVERY UM DEVICE YOU'VE GOT A UH A F A B A PART UH DISPLAY OF A PART BUTTONS
SO UH YOU YOU NEVER GOT UH ALL THE BUTTONS UH ON W ONE DEVICE
SO UH THAT'S UH MY UH IDEA ABOUT IT
HMM
'KAY
SO A TOUCHSCREEN
UH AND UM TH THE BUTTONS UH THE REAL BUTTONS UH WE HAVE TO USE UM
UH YEAH
UH LET'S SEE
WE BETTER C UM UH USE UH QUITE UH LARGE BUTTONS UH FOR UM YEAH
EVERYBODY UH HAVE TO USE IT SO
SO UH UM
UH OL EVEN EVEN OLD PEOPLE UM YOUNG PEOPLE
SO UH WE MUST KEEP UH BUTTONS UH QUITE S UH SIMPLE AND QUITE LARGE
YEAH
YEAH
UH YEAH
SO
THAT WAS UH MY UH PART OF IT
ANYBODY HAS QUESTIONS ABOUT THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS
OKAY
WELL I THINK IF WE ARE GONNA USE A TOUCHSCREEN UH WE'RE GONNA GO WAY ABOVE THE TWELVE AND A HALF EUROS
S UM IT'S UH NOT UH IN COLOUR OR SOMETHING
UH IT'S JUST UH UM ONE COLO UH YEAH
N I I DON'T THINK SO
UH YOU GOT UH QUITE A CHEAP UH TOUCHSCREEN
YEAH
TOUCHSCREEN
UH I SEEN UH W UH SOMETHING ON THE INTERNET UH NOT TODAY BUT UH A FEW UH WEEKS AGO
UH YOU GOT UH YEAH QUITE AN UH
A KIND OF UH TOUCHSCREEN UM AND IT'S UH FOR
SO IT'S POSSIBLE
UH TWENTY UH EUROS OR UH LESS UH
HUH
HMM
UH
THAT'S NICE
'KAY
WELL IT WOULD CERTAINLY MAKE A FANCY DESIGN
YEAH
YEAH
BUT THE IT WOULDN'T BE VERY ROBUST
IT'S VERY FRAGILE AND YOU CAN GET SCRATCHES ON IT
SO
THAT IS TRUE
UH MAYBE WE CAN FIRST UM LISTEN TO YOUR PRESENTATION
THAT'S RIGHT
UH AND THEN WE HAVE A LITTLE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE REQUIREMENTS AND UH DESIGN
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
WE WOULD HAVE TO LOOK INTO THAT
UH
YEAH
THAT'S
OKAY
I THINK IT'S GOING TO UH IT'S NOT TOO MUCH
OKAY
UM FIRST ABOUT HOW IT WORKS
THE USER PRESSES A BUTTON
THE REMOTE DETERMINES WHAT BUTTON IT IS USES THE INFRARED TO SEND A SIGNAL TO THE T. V.
OKAY I'VE GOT A PRESENTATION ABOUT THE WORKING DESIGN
THE T. V. SWITCHES TO THE FREQUENCY OR WHAT FUNCTION IT IS
EVERYBODY KNOWS HOW A REMOTE WORKS
IT'S REALLY SIMPLE OF COURSE
IT GOTS CONDUCTIVE DISKS FOR EVERY BUTTON
WHEN THE USER PRESSES A BUTTON A SIGNAL GOT SENT GOES TO THE LED AND TRANSMITS TRANMI TRANSMITS ITS TO THE T. V.
SO WE'VE GOT UM THE THE PLATE
IT'S A VERY SIMPLE DEVICE TECHNICALLY SPEAKING
SO THIS IS A SCHEMATIC OVERVIEW
AND UH WHEN A BUTTON GETS PRESSED ITS GOES TO THE CHIP
THE POWER SOURCE
WHEN YOU PRESS A BUTTON YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE YOUR PRESSED BUTTON
THE CHIP UH CONTROLS THE INFRARED BULB AND PERF PERHAPS A NORMAL BULB
YOU'VE GOT THE BUTTONS
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE GOING TO USE HIGH TECH MATERIALS THE PRICE IS GOING TO GO SKY HIGH
KEEP THE INNER WORKINGS SIMPLE SO IT'S ROBUST
UH I THINK WE SHOULD FOCUS ON AESTHETICS THE DESIGN AND THE USER INTERFACE
WELL UM I THINK WE SHOULD USE DEFAULT MATERIALS SIMPLE PLASTICS
AND UH YOU ONLY HAVE TO DESIGN A REMOTE ONCE AND IF YOU USE HIGH TECH MATERIALS IT COME BACK IN EVERY PRODUCT
SO IT'S IN MY IDEA IT'S UH IT'S GONNA BE SMART TO INVEST IN DI IN DESIGN AND NOT IN UH IN THE PRODUCT ITSELF
THAT'S IT
THANK YOU
OKAY
OKAY
UH
UM I'M THE PROJECT MANAGER SO I'M HERE TO MESS THINGS UP AND UH TELL YOU SOME NEW UH REQUIREMENTS
OKAY NOW I HOPE EVERYBODY HAS A LITTLE BIT MORE INSIGHT IN THE FUNCTIONS WE ALL HAVE AND WHAT WE ARE DOING RIGHT NOW
UM THAT'S BECAUSE UH IT WILL BE TOO COMPLEX AND THE TIME TO MARKET WILL BE TOO BIG IF WE WANNA HAVE IT UH FOR MORE FUNCTIONS
UM THAT'S WE'VE UH GOT TO DESIGN A UM REMOTE WHICH IS ONLY SUITABLE FOR T. V.
OKAY
MM
UH ANOTHER POINT IS WE HAVE TO SKIP THE TELETEXT
SO IT HAS TO BE SIMPLE
AND UH IT'S A FUNCTION WE DON'T NEED IN OUR REMOTE CONTROL
BECAUSE IN THE WORLD OF UH UPCOMING INTERNET UH WE THINK TELETEXT IS GOING TO BE UH A THING OF THE PAST
UH MAYBE ALSO ON TELEVISIONS IT WILL BE AVAILABLE AS WELL
UM INTERNET IS ALSO MENTIONED IN A FUNCTION WE CAN USE
UH THAT'S THE THE MARKET WE HAVE TO TO TO TARGET BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO DEVELOP A NEW PRODUCT WHICH IS SPECIALLY DESIGNED FOR THE YOUNGER CUSTOMERS
ANOTHER ONE IS UH THE CUSTOMER IS UH FORTY PLUS
SO WE HAVE TO FIND A MARKET WHICH IS ABOVE FORTY PLUS UH BUT WHICH WILL SUIT OUR
BECAUSE HE WAS UH AIMING ON THE THE YOUNGER PERSONS
UM THIS IS UH A BIT PITY FOR THE MARKETING UH EXPERT
UH REMOTE CONTROL AND THE OTHER WAY ROUND
SO IT HAS TO BE VISIBLE IN OUR DESIGN IN THE WAY OUR DEVICE WORKS
AND WE HAVE TO BE VERY UH ATTENT IN UH PUTTING THE CORPORATE IMAGE UH IN OUR PRODUCT
AND UH WE HAVE TO BE UH VERY CLEAR ON THIS POINT AS WELL
SO I SUGGEST
LET'S HAVE A DISCUSSION ON THE CONTROL FUNCTIONS
YEAH
SO IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION POSSIBLE ABOUT THE NEW PRODUCT REQUIREMENT
UM
UH WE CAN SEE IF WE CAN FIND A WAY UH BETWEEN THE FUNCTIONS WE WANNA USE AND THE MARKET WE WANNA REACH WITH OUR PRODUCT
MM
YEAH 'CAUSE YOU'RE YOU'RE SAYING THAT TELETEXT IS GONNA BE AN OLD FEATURE AND IT'S NOT GONNA BE USED ANYMORE ANYWAY PRETTY SOON
AND NEW T. V. S WILL HAVE INTERNET ACCESS ON THEM
BUT I THINK IF YOU'RE TARGETING PEOPLE OF FORTY PLUS THE CHANCE THAT THEY WILL HAVE A T. V. WITH INTERNET ACCESS
WITHIN THE NEXT LIKE TWENTY YEARS IS VERY SLIM
SO I THINK IT'S PRETTY DUMB TO PUT NO TELETEXT FEATURE ON IT
IN ADDITION PEOPLE INDICATED THAT TELETEXT SIMPLY WAS AN IMPORTANT FEATURE FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH
I'M PRETTY MUCH AGAINST IT
AGAINST THE NO TELETEXT
MM
YES
UM
BESIDES THAT I THINK THE MARKET FOR FORTY PLUS IS LIKE
PRETTY SMALL
BUT I MEAN IF I S IF I SEE THIS IT'S I THINK WE'RE JUST GONNA GO FOR ANOTHER
FORTY
YEAH IT'S IT IS
STANDARD REMOTE
PRETTY
NO I THINK WE CAN
AND NOT INNOVATIVE
UH IF WE PUT A LOT OF EFFORT IN THOSE WE CAN MAKE A REMOTE CONTROL WITH UH JUST TWO OR THREE BUTTONS
I THINK WE CAN DO A LOT WITH THE DESIGN AND THE SIMPLE BUTTONS WHICH WERE ALSO MENTIONED
OR JUST A REMOTE WHICH IS SUITABLE FOR THE MARKET WE WANNA REACH BECAUSE IT IS FORTY PERCENT OF THE MARKET
REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH
AND UM IF YOU LOOK IN HOLLAND AT THE WHOLE GENERATION OF FORTY PLUS
FIFTY PLUS IT IT'S THE THE BIGGEST SHARE OF THE OF THE WHOLE POPULATION NOW
YES BUT IT'S NOT THE BIGGEST PART OF THE
MARKET
NO
AND BESIDES THAT THEY'RE NOT VERY CRITICAL SO I MEAN THEY DON'T REALLY CARE
THEY'LL JUST PRETTY MUCH TAKE THE FIRST THING THEY SEE AND WHICH LOOKS ACCEPTABLE
WHAT THE REMOTE CONTROL IS LIKE
BUT DON'T YOU THINK THAT IF WE MAKE A REMOTE WHICH IS UH TYPICALLY MADE FOR THIS MARKET
THAT PEOPLE THINK THE PEOPLE THINK THAT'S THE THE DEVICE I'VE LOOKED FOR ALTHOUGH I DIDN'T REALISE IT
SO LET'S TRY IT
NO
I THINK THAT WOULD BE THE CASE IN THE
SIXTEEN TO FORTY FIVE AGE CATEGORY
BECAUSE THEY ARE CRITICAL AND THEY THEY WANT TO HAVE A FANCY REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH
PEOPLE OF FORTY PLUS I MEAN THEY WANT IT TO WORK BUT
AS SOO AS SOON AS IT WORKS IT'S OKAY WITH THEM
MM
YEAH
THE THE ELDERLY MOBILE PHONE
I THINK THAT IF WE'RE IF WE PUT OUR MARKETING RIGHT UM WE CAN SELL THIS JUST LIKE UM I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT IT IN THE NEWS
SO
YEAH
IT'S A BIG SUCCESS
WE JUST
YEAH IF WE IF WE MAKE A REMOTE CONTROL JUST L WITH THAT IDEA IN MIND WE COULD MAKE TONS OF MONEY I THINK
WE DON'T HAVE TO FOCUS ON ON ON THE ON THE DESIGN THEN BUT ON FUNCTIONALITY
I HAVEN'T HEARD OF IT
YEAH
VERY BIG SUCCESS
HMM
I THINK SO AS WELL
UH
MM
CHANGE OUR FOCUS ON THE PROJECT AND I THINK
WE CAN UH WE CAN SELL THIS
UH I SIMPLY THINK UM
UH THAT THE NEW PRODUCTS WE ARE GONNA MAKE UH SPEF SPECIFICALLY DESIGN
ARE DESIGNED FOR UH YOUNGER PEOPLE UH SO MAYBE WE CAN FOCUS OURSELF ON THE ELDERLY PEOPLE
AND I THINK WE HAVE TO UM SEE WHAT REQUIREMENTS WE NEED FOR THOSE UM REMOTE CONTROLS
UM
VOLUME SELECTION POWER AND TELETEXT
'CAUSE WHAT YOU TOLD IS THE CHANNEL SELECTION IS IMPORTANT
OKAY
YES
MM
YES
YEAH
BUT OBVIOUSLY THE BOARD TENDS TO DISAGREE
NO WE WE HAVEN'T VOTED YET SO UH I THINK TELETEXT CAN BE UH
UM CAN BE A FUNCTION AS WELL
BUT ONLY IF UH IF IT WON'T
HIGHER THE THE COST
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW IF IT WILL BE A LOT MORE MONEY TO IMPLEMENT TELETEXT AS WELL BUT I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE A PROBLEM
OR IS TELETEXT A
SO IT'S YEAH
BUT UM DEAF PEOPLE NEED UH TELETEXT FOR UH FOR SUBTITLES
YEAH
YEAH ALSO
YEAH
SO I SUGGEST UH
I THINK IT'D DEFINITELY BE A BAD IDEA NOT TO INCLUDE TELETEXT
IT'S
MM
YEAH
IS ANYBODY UM REALLY AGAINST TELETEXT
NO
JUST THAT THAT WE JUST KEEP THE TELETEXT
NO
I THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA AS WELL ESPECIALLY FOR THE SUBTITLES
MAYBE WE CAN
MAKE THAT UM
ANOTHER POINT OF ADVANTAGE IN OUR REMOTE CONTROL
IF WE UH MAKE A K A BUTTON EX FOR EXAMPLE FOR BIG SUBTITLES WHICH IS INSTANTLY ON THE REMOTE CONTROL
FOR ELDERLY PEOPLE THEY CAN THINK OH I WANNA HAVE SUBTITLES AND THEY PUSH THE BUTTON AND THEY GET THE BIG SUBTITLES
YEAH YEAH
UH THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
YEAH
YEAH
UM
UM SO I THINK TELETEXT CAN V CAN BE VERY USEFUL IN OUR ADVANTAGE
FUNCTIONALITY SHOULD BE FEW BUTTONS YOU SAID
YES
I THINK UH THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT WE HAVE A FEW BUTTONS
YEAH
MM-HMM
SO TO KEEP IT SIMPLE
BUT
I DON'T THINK THAT'S REALLY AN ISSUE ANY MORE 'CAUSE
WELL MIGHT BE
IF IT'S ONLY FOR TELEVI YEAH
YOU NEED A ONE TO ZERO BUTTON NEXT CHANNEL PREVIOUS CHANNEL
BUT I MEAN IT IF IT'S ONLY FOR T. V. YOU'RE NOT GONNA NEED A LOT OF BUTTONS ANYWAY
YEAH
NO
YEAH
VOLUME UP VOLUME DOWN AND SOME TELETEXT BUTTONS BUT
YEAH
BUT DO YOU NEED
I THINK IF YOU IF YOU ONLY L
SO WE CAN S WE CAN SKIP THE DISPLAY SO UH WE DON'T NEED IT
MAYBE C WE CAN
BUT DO YOU NEED THE BUTTONS FOR ONE TO ZERO
NAH
UH
I THINK MANY PEOPLE LIKE TO USE THAT
'CAUSE IF YOU SHOULD IF YOU WANT TO SWITCH FROM CHANNEL ONE TO LIKE THIRTY FIVE YOU DON'T WANNA PUSH THE NEXT CHANNEL BUTTON THIRTY FIVE TIMES
THINK IF YOU'RE GONNA INCLUDE TELETEXT YOU DO
MAYBE WE CAN USE UH
YEAH
YEAH
NO MAYBE WE CAN IMPLEMENT THE SCROLL BUTTON
OR A JOYSTICK LIKE
MM
THE SONY TELEPHONE HAS A SCROLL BUTTON WHICH IS VERY USEFUL IN SEARCHING NAMES OR
JUST LOOK IF YOU LOOK AT TELEPHONES
THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TOO
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
THAT'S TRUE BUT UM
AND SO YOU WOULD NEED LIKE
I DON'T THINK THERE ARE MANY T. V. S THAT CAN SWITCH CHANNELS THAT FAST
THE T. V. WOULD NEED AN A FUNCTION WHERE YOU CAN ACTUALLY VIEW ALL CHANNELS AND SCROLL THROUGH IT
AND I DUNNO IF MANY CHANNELS WOULD
IF MANY T. V. S HAVE THAT
DO HAVE THAT
AND BESIDES THAT IT'S UM IF WE'RE GONNA FOCUS ON ELDERLY PEOPLE THEY'LL HAVE TO ADAPT
THEY'RE NOT USED TO USING SCROLL BUTTONS
YEAH
SO PERHAPS WE SHOULD S STICK TO THE BASIC LAYOUT
MM
THAT'S RIGHT
MM-HMM
MM
THE NUMBERS YEAH
OR THERE DON'T HAVE TO BE A LOT
YEAH THEY CAN SEE HOW MUCH BUTTONS THERE ARE GOING TO BE ON ON THE DISPLAY AND IF IT'S TOO MUCH WE CAN UH RECONSIDER IT
BUT I THINK THERE WON'T BE VERY MUCH BUTTONS
YEAH
BUT I DON'T THINK I THINK IF YOU'RE GONNA MAKE A REMOTE CONTROL ONLY TO OPERATE A T. V. YOU THERE'S NOT MUCH YOU CAN GAIN ON
UM HAVING AS FEW BUTTONS AS POSSIBLE
'CAUSE I THINK THERE ARE PRETTY MANY REMOTE CONTROLS THAT CAN ONLY OPERATE A T. V. WHICH ALREADY ONLY HAVE THE MINIMUM NUMBER OF BUTTONS
I DON'T THINK THERE'S MUCH TO BE GAINED IN THAT AREA
I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT IN THE IN THE DESIGN
THE NUMBER OF BUTTONS
HMM
YEAH
YOU CAN MAKE A VERY FANCY DESIGN UH WITH PUTTING THE BUTTONS ON THE RIGHT PLACES
AND IF YOU HAVE LESS BUTTONS YOU CAN DO A LOT MORE WITH
THAT IS TRUE BUT I THINK THERE'S SIMPLY NOT MUCH TO GAIN ON THE COMPETITION WHEN YOU WHEN YOU'RE MAKING A REMOTE CONTROL ONLY FOR TO OPERATE ONLY THE T. V.
TO OPERATE ONLY THE T. V. YEAH
'CAUSE IF YOU HAVE A A REMOTE CONTROL ONLY TO OPERATE A T. V. THERE'S SIMPLY NOT A LOT OF BUTTONS REQUIRED
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF FUNCTIONS REQUIRED SO MOST EXISTING REMOTE CONTROLS SIMPLY DON'T HAVE A LOT OF BUTTONS EITHER
NO
NO
SO
SO I THINK IT WOULD BE VERY HARD TO ACTUALLY GAIN ON THE COMPETITION HERE
'KAY
SO WE CAN
THAT WOULD THAT WOULD COST A A BIG MARKETING
EXPEDITION
YEAH
THAT'S RIGHT
WHICH WAS
ONE OF THE ARGUMENTS TO MAKE IT ONLY FOR THE T. V. BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE THE TIME TO MARKET A LOT
SO YOU SUGGEST WE COULD BETTER UM FOCUS ON FOR EXAMPLE THE DOCKING STATION
YEAH
UH UH LIKE OTHER FUNCTIONS
INSTEAD OF F OF LESS BUTTONS
MAYBE
WELL
YEAH I THINK MEAN WE OBVIOUSLY NEED A GOOD WAY TO POSITION ALL THE BUTTONS AND
BUT I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD SPEND VERY MUCH TIME IN THAT
MM
DO YOU THINK THE DOCKING STATION WILL
NO
UH IS ALLOWED IN THE BUDGET WE HAVE
AND IF THE REMOTE STAYS RATHER SMALL IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE YEAH
IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE YES
IF IT'S NOT TOO FANCY
'CAUSE IT CAN BE
NO
NO
YEAH
BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S UH
NO
IF WE HAVE A FANCY LOOKING DOCKING STATION OR VERY THAT'S A NICE REQUIREMENT
THAT'S A GOOD ADVANTAGE POINT AS WELL
YES
HMM
DOCKING STATION
SO WE'RE JUST GONNA FOCUS ON THE EXTRAS
I THINK SO
YEAH
MM
YEAH I THINK MAYBE WE SHOULD DO SOME RESEARCH INTO
WHAT ELDERLY PEOPLE LIKE TO HAVE IN A
YEAH
LIKE TO HAVE EXTRA IN A NEW REMOTE CONTROL
THAT'S A GOOD POINT
UM
YOU SAID THEY EASILY GET LOST AS WELL
YES WELL FIFTY PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE INDICATED THAT REMOTE CONTROL TENDED TO GET LOST
YEAH
SO MAYBE WE SHOULD IMPLEMENT THE AUDIO SIGN OR SOMETHING
YEAH THAT WAS WHAT I SUGGESTED
YOU HAVE IT ON YEAH YOU HAVE IT'S ON SOME PHONES TOO WHICH HAVE A DOCKING STATION
AND YOU JUST PRESS A BUTTON AND THE PHONE GOES RINGING
YEAH
LIKE WITH YOUR KEY CHAIN IF YOU WHISTLE IT GOES UH IT MAKES A SOUND
YEAH
HM
YEAH
UH ANOTHER
YEAH
SO AUDIO SIGNAL SHOULD BE POSSIBLE AS WELL
I THINK IT'S NOT TOO EXPENSIVE
SO YOU KNOW WHERE IT IS
NO
POINT IS THE L. C. D. SCREEN
UM I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WILL RISE THE COST TOO MUCH BECAUSE
Y I UM I THINK WE'LL HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THE DOCKING STATION OR THE SCREEN 'CAUSE
IT WILL BE TOO MUCH AS WELL
YEAH
IT'S UH
MM
I THINK SINCE A LOT OF PEOPLE INDICATED THAT A NEW REMOTE CONTROL IS HARD TO LEARN
AND WE'RE FOCUSING ON ELDERLY PEOPLE HERE WHICH TEND TO HAVE A HARD TIME UNDERSTANDING NEW DEVICES
WHICH WOULD TELL YOU WHAT IT DOES
IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA TO HAVE JUST A LITTLE SCREEN ON IT WHICH WOULD EXPLAIN A BUTTON IF YOU PRESS IT
YEAH
AND IT WOULDN'T HAVE TO BE TOUCHSCREEN OR A VERY EXPENSIVE SCREEN BUT
BASED
OKAY
YEAH
OH JUST THE NORMAL SCREEN
JUST THE L. C. D.
JUST A SMALL SCREEN WITH TWO
FEEDBACK
SO SOME EXTRA INFO
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
YEAH
I THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA AS WELL
YEAH
YEAH
BUT I DUNNO IF THAT WOULD
AS THE SMALL SCREEN
THAT WOULD FIT INTO THE
COSTS
EXTRA BUTTON INFO
MM
UM LET'S SEE WHAT DID WE SAY
FEW BUTTONS WE TALKED ABOUT THAT
UM GENERAL FUNCTIONS
I THINK THAT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE AS WELL
SHOULD BE FANCY TO FANCY DESIGN EASY TO LEARN
DOCKING STATION L. C. D.
MORE
YEAH
'KAY
AND DEFAULT MATERIALS
SO THAT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER
SO I THINK WE NEE
I THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA AS WELL BECAUSE UM ELDERLY PEOPLE DON'T MIND IF IT'S A TITANIUM COVER OR JUST A PLASTIC ONE
NO
MM
I THINK PROBABLY ELDERLY PEOPLE WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT MORE CAREFUL WITH THEIR REMOTE CONTROLS THAN
YOUNGSTERS
UH LET'S UM SPECIFY THE TARGET GROUP
BECAUSE ARE WE TALKING ABOUT ELDERLY ELDERLY PEOPLE OR PEOPLE FROM FORTY TO EIGHTY
BECAUSE I THINK WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DESIGN NOW IS FOR PEOPLE ABOVE SIXTY MAYBE
YEAH
MM
YEAH
UH WHAT DO WE WANT
IF WE WANT UM A WITH UH FOR EXAMPLE THE THE TELEPHONE FOR ELDERLY PEOPLE WE CAN
I THINK
TARGET THE REAL ELDERLY PEOPLE
I THINK THAT WOULD BE A IF WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT IT WOULD BE A
I THINK IT WOULD BE REALLY GOOD FOR UH FOR THE IMAGE OF THE COMPANY
YEAH
AND I THINK I THINK THERE WOULD BE A GOOD MARKET FOR IT
SO THAT'S THE
IF WE'RE ABLE TO REALLY BRING AN INNOVATIVE PRODUCT
NOW YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SIXTY TO EIGHTY FOR EXAMPLE
YEAH THE REALLY
SIXTY
YEAH
MM
BUT
I'D HAVE TO LOOK INTO THAT A LITTLE MORE
AND DIFFERENT CULTURES
OKAY
ARE WE
WELL I DON'T THINK THEY HAVE DIFFERENT TELEVISION SETS UH
MM
OKAY
IN UH EVERY COUNTRY
NO
NO
'CAUSE
WE'VE GOT FIVE MINUTES LEFT JUST NOW
SMALL WARNING
SO 'KAY
AND WITH UH THE LITTLE SCREEN IN IT WHICH EXPLAINS THE BUTTONS
YOU COULD I THINK WE N IT WOULD BE A LOT EASIER TO
'KAY
SHOULD
ADAPT IT TO DIFFERENT CULTURES
YEAH
IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES YOU KNOW
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
OR YOU HAVE TO PUT A LANGUAGE BUTTON IN IT BUT THAT WILL BE A BIT UNNECESSARY I THINK
SO THAT'S THE THE TARGET
IT'S BETTER TO PUT IT ON DIFFERENT MARKETS WITH IT ALL
UH THEN A FEW SMALL THINGS
OKAY
RIGHT
YEAH
NO
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
I WILL PUT THE MINUTES IN THE PROJECT UH PROJECT DOCUMENT FOLDER
UM WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO FOR THE NEXT MEETING IS THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER WILL DO THE COMPONENTS CONCEPT
USER INTERFACE DESIGNER THE USER INTERFACE CONCEPT AND THE TREND WATCHING
UH OKAY
SO JUST KEEP IN MIND THE THINGS WE'VE SAID ABOUT THE TARGET GROUP UH REQUIREMENTS AND THE TRENDS WHICH ARE UH GOING ON
AND UH SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS WILL BE SENT TO YOU BY UH THE PERSONAL COACH
'KAY
SO UM I THANK YOU FOR THIS MEETING
AND I THINK WE HAVE A LUNCH BREAK NOW
THAT'S GOOD
YEAH
SO THAT'S A GOOD THING
THIS IS OUR THIRD MEETING ALREADY
OKAY
UM LET'S SEE
I DID ANYWAY
UH GOOD AFTERNOON
I HOPE YOU ENJOYED YOUR LUNCH
GOOD AFTERNOON
AND A FEW POINTS OF INTEREST IN THIS MEETING UM ARE THE CONCEPTUAL SPECIFICATION OF COMPONENTS
OKAY THIS IS UM THE SECOND PHASE UH WE'RE GOING TO DISCUSS TODAY
IT'S THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN MEETING
PRESENTATION THREE
AND ALSO TREND WATCHING
UH CONCEPTUAL SPECIFICATION OF DESIGN
UM THESE ARE HOPEFULLY THE POINTS YOU ADDRESSED IN UH YOUR PRE UH PRESENTATIONS YOU'RE GOING TO SHOW ME IN A FEW MINUTES
AND THEN WE'RE CLOSING
UH FIRST THE OPENING
THEN WE HAVE THREE PRESENTATIONS
HOW WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT
WE HAVE ABOUT FORTY MINUTES
UM BUT FIRST I'LL SHOW YOU THE AGENDA
UH AFTER THAT WE HAVE TO COME TO A DECISION ON REMOTE CONTROL CONCEPTS
UH SO I SUGGEST LET'S GET STARTED
UH DID SOMEONE ENCOUNTER ANY PROBLEMS DURING THE PREPARATION
THAT'S NICE
NO
EVERYTHING FINE
NO
THEN A LITTLE UH THING ABOUT THE LAST MEETING
AND WE ARE GOING TO USE DEFAULT MATERIALS
THE REQUIREMENTS AND THE TARGET MARKET
UH THESE ARE THE POINTS UM WE AGREED ON
UH REQUIREMENTS ARE UH TELETEXT DOCKING STATION AUDIO SIGNAL SMALL SCREEN WITH SOME EXTRAS THAT UH BUTTON INFORMATION
MAYBE
THESE ARE JUST THE THE THINGS WE THOUGHT OF SO MAYBE IF YOU FIGURED SOMETHING ELSE OR THOUGHT OF SOMETHING ELSE JUST LET ME KNOW
AND MAYBE WE CAN UH WORK IT OUT
NO
UM DOES SOMEBODY HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON THESE REQUIREMENTS
AND WE'RE GOING TO TARGET UH SIXTY TO TO EIGHTY YEAR OLD CUSTOMERS
SO NOW EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT WE'RE DO WE'RE DOING UM I SUGGEST LET'S GET STARTED WITH THE PRESENTATIONS
SO SHALL WE KEEP THE SAME UH LINE UP AS UH LAST TIME
SURE
I'LL START OFF THEN
OKAY
GOOD LUCK
DOH
UM WE'VE DONE SOME MARKET RESEARCH
WE DISTRIBUTED SOME MORE ENQUETES QUESTIONNAIRES
'KAY I'M UH GONNA INFORM YOU ABOUT THE TREND WATCHING I'VE DONE OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS
AND I'VE CONSULTED SOME ADDITIONAL TREND WATCH TREND WATCHERS AFTER THE ORIGINAL TREND WATCHERS RETURN ABOUT WHAT THE
AND UM BESIDES THAT UM I DEPLOYED SOME TREND WATCHERS TO MILAN AND PARIS TO WELL GET ALL OF THE NEWEST TRENDS
UM MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THE FANCY DESIGN
UM THE RESEARCH INDICATED THAT THAT WAS BY FAR THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR
UM OKAY THESE ARE SOME OVERALL FINDINGS
THE BEST DESIGN WOULD BE
BY INNOVATIVENESS THIS MEANS UM FUNCTIONS WHICH ARE NOT FEATURED IN OTHER REMOTE CONTROLS
UM INNOVATIVENESS WAS ABOUT HALF AS IMPORTANT AS THE FANCY DESIGN
UM ABOUT HALF OF HALF AS IMPORTANT AS THE INNOVATIVENESS WAS THE WAS EASY TO USE
UM FOR OUR UM GROUP WE'RE FOCUSING ON THE PEOPLE OF SIXTY TO EIGHTY Y YEARS OLD THIS IS UM THESE FACTORS ARE SLIGHTLY MORE EQUAL
AND OUR SURVEYS HAVE INDICATED THAT ESPECIALLY WOOD IS PRETTY MUCH
'KAY THESE ARE SOME MORE GROUP SPECIFIC FINDINGS
UH THE OLDER PEOPLE PREFER DARK COLOURS
UH THEY LIKE RECOGNISABLE SHAPES AND FAMILIAR MATERIAL
UM THIS IS THIS IMAGE WILL GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF AN IMPRESSION ABOUT UM THE LOOK AND FEEL THAT UM THE REMOTE SHOULD HAVE
THE MATERIAL FOR OLDER PEOPLE
UM THIS LEADS US TO SOME PERSONAL PREFERENCES
UH THE REMOTE CONTROL AND THE DOCKING STATION SHOULD UH BLEND IN IN THE
IN THE ROOM
UM SO THIS WOULD MEAN NO UH EYE CATCHING DESIGNS
JUST KEEP IT SIMPLE AND WELL THE DOCKING STATION AND SMALL SCREEN WOULD BE OUR MAIN POINTS OF INTEREST
BECAUSE THIS WOULD BE THE THESE WOULD UH BE THE INNOVATIVENESS IN THE REMOTE CONTROL
SO THIS WOULD BE VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE AT LEAST INCLUDE THESE FEATURES
UM WELL THE TREND WATCHERS I CONSULTED ADVISED THAT IT B SHOULD BE THE REMOTE CONTROL AND THE DOCKING STATION SHOULD BE TELEPHONE SHAPED
SO YOU COULD IMAGINE THAT UH THE REMOTE CONTROL WILL BE STANDING UP STRAIGHT IN THE DOCKING STATION
SO IT WOULD BE KINDA MORE TELEPHONE SHAPED
THIS IS NOT REALLY THIS IS PRETTY MUCH A NEW SHAPE TO UH OLDER PEOPLE
SO THEY WOULD PREFER UH A DESIGN WHERE THE REMOTE CONTROL JUST LIES FLAT IN THE DOCKING STATION
UH THE GREY BLACK COLOUR FOR WELL
UM BESIDES THAT WE WOULD ADVISE UM TO BRING TWO EDITIONS ONE WITH A WOOD LIKE COLOUR AND MAYBE FEEL AND ONE WITH A GREY BLACK COLOUR
PEOPLE WITH MORE MONEY
THE WOOD LIKE FOR THE MORE UH EXCLUSIVE PEOPLE
PEOPLE WITH LESS MEANS
THAT WOULD BE ALL
MAYB
ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE THE TRENDS
THANK YOU
OKAY
ANY QUESTIONS
MM NO
NO
OKAY WE GO ON TO THE NEXT ONE
UM 'KAY UM YEAH
UM THE UH LAST MEETING UH WE HAD A ABOUT UM UH USING A F FEW BUTTONS
SO UH UM UH THAT'S W WHAT I WHAT I WANT TO UH
UH SOME UH RESEARCH UH A ABOUT UM DESIGNING OF AN INTERFACE
UM THE UH I FOUND SOME UH SOMETHING ABOUT UH SPEECH UH RECOGNITION
UM
SO MAYBE UH WE CAN UH USE UH THAT
SO UM FINDING AN ATTRACTIVE UH WAY TO CONTROL UH THE REMOTE CONTROL
UH TO DO IN UH OUR DESIGN
SO UM FINDINGS
UM YEAH JUST UM WE HAVE JUST TO FOCUS ON THE PRIMARY UM FUNCTIONS
UH AND UH USING A LITTLE UH DISPLAY
UM YEAH AND
SO UH ONLY UH BUTTONS UH FOR UH SOUND UM FOR UH ON OFF UM UH SHIFTING U UP UH SA UH CA CHANNEL OR UH DOWN SHIFTING DOWN
UM UH LET'S SEE
JUST UH WHAT WE UH MENTIONED UH LAST UH MEETING
SO UH IT'S UH LIKE A SPEAK UH SPEECH UH RECOGNITION AND UM A SPECIAL BUTTON FOR SELECTING UH SUBTITLES
UH WE UH NEED SOME UH NEW A ATTRACTIVE FUNCTIONS UH UH WHICH ATTRACT UH UH PEOPLE FOR USING IT
UM AND YEAH OVERALL UM USER FRIENDLY
UM
SO UH USING UH LARGE LARGE BUTTONS
IT'S UH POSSIBLE TO UH UH TO MAKE UM QUITE CHEAP UH SYSTEM FOR UH SPEECH UH RECOGNITION
SO UH UH YEAH
UM YOU CAN THINK ABOUT UM UH WHEN YOU LOST YOUR UM REMOTE CONTROL YOU CAN UH CALL IT AND UM IT GIVES AN UM SIG SIGNAL
YOU CAN UH JUST GIVE A SIGN UH SAY UM SOUND OFF OR
AND AND UH FOR UH SHIFTING UP A SEN UH C CH CHANNEL OR UH FOR UM UH PUTTING OUT UH SOUND OR SOMETHING
TELEVISION UH PUT THE SOUND OFF UH PUT THE SOUND OFF UH
A AND UH YEAH
UM
I WAS THINKING ABOUT THE SPECIAL UH BUTTON FOR UH SUBTITLES UM JUST ONE BUTTON TO KEEP IT UH SIMPLE
LET'S SEE
UH YEAH
UH ONE PUSH ON THE BUTTON UH YOU GET UH UH SMALL UH SUBTITLES
UM DOUBLE PUSH PUSH UM IF DOUBLE CLICK UM SO UH YOU GET UH BIG UH SUBTITLES FOR UH PEOPLE UH
UM UH WHICH C F UH WHO CAN'T UH READ SMALL UH SUBTITLES
SO UH UM
THE ON OFF SOUND ON OFF SOUND HIGHER OR LOWER UM THE NUMBERS UH ZERO TO UH UH NINE
YEAH AND W WE HAVE TO KEEP UH IN GENERAL BUTTONS UH SO UM WE'VE GOT UM THE BUTTONS WE HAVE TO USE
UM THE GENERAL BUTTONS M MORE GENERAL B ONE BUTTON FOR SHIFTING UP AND SHIFTING DOWN UH CHANNEL
UM ALSO WE WANT TO UH USE A LITTLE D DISPLAY UH FOR UM FOR DISPLAYING THE UH THE FUNCTIONS OF THE BUTTONS
SO UM MADE A LITTLE UH PICTURE OF UH IT
AND UM WE CAN UH BUILD IN A FUNCTION F WHICH UH SHOWS THE CHANNEL OR SOME UH WHICH THE T TELEVISION IS ON
UM
SEE
UM ALMOST UH E ALL UH REMOTE CONTROLS UH ARE USING A ON OFF BUTTON ON THAT PLACE
UM YEAH
UM SO UH PEOPLE UH WILL UH RECOGNISE UH UM THE BUTTON
JUST UM WE CAN PUT UH THE ON OFF BUTTON UH OVER IN THIS UH CORNER
SO UM
UM IT'S UH MOST UH
D DISPLAY UH OF IT IT'S UH JUST A SMALL DISPLAY
UH UM YOU CAN PUT IT UH ON TOP
UM IT'S UH ON PLACE WHERE UM THE THUMB OF OF THE
SO UH UM AND A SPECIAL UH BUTTON FOR SHIFTING UP UH AND UH SHIFTING DOWN UH CHANNEL
UH PLACE WHERE PEOPLE UH MOST OF LOOKS AT
SO YOU YOU CAN UH EASILY UH SHIFT UP OR SHIFT DOWN
UM IT'S UH QUITE UH
SO UM AND UH ALL THE F FUNCTIONS FOR SUBTITLE UH ONE BUTTON UH FOR SOUND UH
HANDY PLACE
UH AND UH FOR OUR DESIGN UM UH WE HAVE TO DISCUSS ABOUT IT UH I THINK UH SO UH THE FORM OF IT SO
OKAY
AND THAT'S IT
UH THANK YOU
OKAY
SO I DON'T THINK IT'S REALLY AN OPTION
UM FOR THE ENERGY SOURCE WE CAN USE A BASIC BATTERY OR A AS AN OPTIONAL THING
A KINETIC ENERGY LIKE IN A WATCH WHICH YOU JUST SHAKE AND IT PRODUCES ENERGY
BUT IF WE CHOOSE FOR THAT OPTION THE DOCKING STATION WOULD C BECOME OBSOLETE
ABOUT THE COMPONENTS DESIGN
UH FOR THE CASING UH THE UH MANUFACTURING DEPARTMENT CAN DELIVER UH A FLAT CASING SINGLE OR DOUBLE CURVED CASING
IT'S REALLY UP THE THE DESIGN THAT WE'RE GONNA USE
IT'S UH DOESN'T UH IMPLY ANY TECHNICAL RESTRICTIONS
UH AS A CASE SUPPLEMENT WE COULD UM I THOUGHT OF THAT L LATER UH A RUBBER UH BELT LIKE A ANTI SLIP
AND THE CHIP SET UM IT SAYS SIMPLE HERE BUT IT SHOULD BE ADVANCED BECAUSE WE'RE USING AN L. C. D. UH SCREEN
UH FOR THE B BUTTONS WE CAN USE PLASTIC OR RUBBER
BUT IT RAISES THE PRICE AND IT DOESN'T REALLY FIT THE IMAGE UNLESS WE WOULD START TWO PRODUCT LINES
AND AS UH THE TREND WATCHER PRESENTATION SHOWED UM PEOPLE LIKE WOOD
FORM SHOULD FOLLOW FUNCTION OVERALL
AND THE CHIP SET UH REALLY SHOULD BE ADVANCED BECAUSE OTHERWISE UH IT WOULD REALLY BE A SIMPLE UH REMOTE CONTROL
I THINK WE SHOULD DISC DISCUSS THAT
UM FOR THE CASE UH THE SUPPLEMENT AND THE BUTTONS IT REALLY DEPENDS ON THE DESIGNER
UM WELL THE KINETIC ENERGY SOURCE IS RATHER FANCY
BUT DEPENDS ON WHAT WE WANT
AND THAT'S IT
OKAY
THANK YOU
SO THAT BRINGS US TO THE DISCUSSION ABOUT OUR CONCEPTS
MM
'KAY
SO THESE ARE THE POINTS WE HAVE TO DISCUSS
UM FIRST
I THINK WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE ENERGY SOURCE SINCE THAT'S UM
HAS A PRETTY BIG INFLUENCE ON PRODUCTION PRICE UH AND IMAGE
UH SO
UH F I THINK FIRST OF ALL WE HAVE TO SEE UH IT IS POSSIBLE TO INTRODUCE KINETIC ENERGY IN OUR BUDGET I THINK
UH A HAND DYNAMO
BUT NOT EVERY ROOM IS VERY LIGHT SO IT'S NOT A VERY GOOD OPTION
BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S REALLY AN OPTION
YOU DON'T WANNA SWING BEFORE YOU CAN WATCH TELEVISION
WE COULD USE THE BASIC NORMAL BATTERY
YES W THERE THERE ARE FOUR OPTIONS
OR THE KINETIC ENERGY
UH SOLAR CELLS
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
MM
NO
OKAY
YEAH
YOU JUST
AND HOW EXACTLY DOES THE KINETIC ENERGY WORK
YEAH
WELL Y YOU BASICALLY SHAKE YOUR REMOTE AND THEN IT POWERS UP
YOU USE IT AND IT WORKS
YEAH
WELL PERSONALLY I DON'T THINK THAT OLDER PEOPLE LIKE TO SHAKE THEIR REMOTE CONTROL BEFORE THEY USE IT
OKAY
NAH
YEAH
THAT'S TRUE
AND I THINK OUR DOCKING STATION COULD BE ONE OF THE MARKETING ISSUES WITH WHICH WE CAN UM
AND BESIDES THAT YOU MENTIONED IT WOULD MAKE THE DOCKING STATION OBSOLETE
OH
GET GREAT POPULARITY FOR OUR PRODUCT
YEAH
BUT
UM WEL
WHAT'S THE FUNCTION
YEAH F FOR LOADING UP UH THE BATTERIES
YEAH YOU COULD LOAD UP THE BATTERIES YOU COULD UM INSERT THE FIND THE LOST REMOTE CONTROL FUNCTION IN THERE
B B
OKAY BUT UH IT WON'T USE UH MUCH E ENERGY UH I I BELIEVE
UH SO
UH IT'S UH JUST A SMALL DISPLAY SO I BELIEVE UH IT WILL RUN ON ONE BATTERY FOR UM SIX MONTHS OR F OR OR MORE
SO I BELIEVE ONE BATTERY UH IS JUST ENOUGH
UH
UH WELL I THINK UH ELDERLY PEOPLE JUST LIKE TO HAVE EVERYTHING IN PLACE
SO MAYBE A DOCKING STATION WILL HELP THEM GIVE THE REMOTE A PLACE
AND I DON'T THINK THEY THEY LIKE UH REMOTES JUST LAYING EVERYWHERE IN THEIR ROOMS
THAT'S TRUE
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
THAT'S TRUE
SO YOU HAVE A BUT BUTTON ON YOUR DOCKING STATION WHICH YOU CAN PUSH AND THEN IT STARTS BEEPING
BUT I THINK IT'S UM MORE EFFICIENT AND CHEAPER TO PUT IT IN THE DOCKING STATION
AND ALSO WHAT YOU SAID
UM YOU CAN INTRODUCE VOICE RECOGNITION BY UH FINDING BACK YOUR REMOTE
MM-HMM
YEAH
OKAY
AND THEN WE CAN WE CAN STILL USE THE VOICE RECOGNITION BUT MAYBE THEN FOR ONLY THE THE CHANNELS
YEAH
UH
THAT'S SAFE
I'M WONDERING UM WHAT WILL THE VOICE RECOGNITION MEAN FOR THE PRODUCTION PRICE
YEAH
THAT'S A GOOD POINT
SO I'LL HAVE TO ASK THE MANUFACTURING DEPARTMENT
MM I DON'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION ON PRICING
MM
'CAUSE IN OUR EARLIER UM MARKET RESEARCH IF YOU'D ALLOW ME TO GO TO THE FLAT BOARD SMARTBOARD
YEAH SURE
GO AHEAD
UM SO IT WAS OPEN HERE
UM WE ALSO UM
ASKED IF W THEY WOULD IF PEOPLE WOULD PAY MORE FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION IN A REMOTE CONTROL
WELL YOU CAN SEE HERE OUR TARGET GROUP WOULD NOT DO THAT
SO IF THAT WOULD INCREASE THE PRICE FOR WHICH WE'RE SELLING OUR REMOTE CONTROL
NO
MM
I THINK THAT WOULD BE BETTER TO UH INSERT IN OUR OTHER PRODUCT THAT IS MEANT FOR THE
I WOULD GREATLY ADVISE NOT TO DO IT
YEAH
YEAH
YOUNGER PEOPLE
BUT THAT WOULD ALSO GO FOR THE L. C. D. SCREEN THEN I GUESS
'KAY
IT'S A BIT HIGHER PERCENTAGE BUT
SO THAT DOESN'T REALLY MEAN THEY WOULDN'T PAY EXTRA FOR IT
AND ON TOP OF THAT THE L. C. D. SCREEN WOULD UM HELP IN MAKING THE REMOTE CONTROL EASIER TO USE
UM WELL THIS IS YEAH BUT THIS IS HERE THE QUESTION WAS WOULD YOU PREFER IT
YEAH
YEAH
AND I THINK A VOICE RECOGNITION FUNCTION WOULD NOT MAKE THE REMOTE CONTROL MUCH EASIER TO USE
OKAY
EASIER TO USE
NO I THINK THAT'S A GOOD POINT
BUT UH IS UH OUR UH RESEARCH UM ABOUT UM BI LARGE UH L. C. D. SH UH DISPLAY OR UH JUST A SMALL ONE UH WE WANT TO UH USE
UM WELL THIS WAS FOR LIKE AN L. C. D. SCREEN LIKE YOU WOULD HAVE ON A ON THE THE MOST ADVANCED MOBILE PHONES
OKAY
SO PRETTY LARGE
YEAH
YEAH
BECAUSE IT'S JUST UH SOME EXTRA INFORMATION AND IT'S EASY TO IGNORE AS WELL
I PERSONALLY THINK THE L. C. D. SCREEN WE WANNA USE WITH THE EXTRA INFORMATION I THINK NOBODY HAS ANYTHING AGAINST IT
SO IF YOU DON'T WANNA USE IT YOU JUST DON'T USE IT
NO
YEAH
AND UM YEAH I THINK THE UM MAYBE WE HAVE TO UH DISCARD THE VOICE RECOGNITION
BECAUSE IT WILL INCREASE COST UH SIGNIFI UH SIGNIFICANTLY
AND I DON'T THINK THE I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE A LOT EASIER TO USE AS WELL
YEAH
SO THAT BRINGS US BACK TO THE ENERGY
UM
IF WE DON'T HAVE THE VOICE RECOGNITION IT WILL IT WON'T USE A LOT OF ENERGY TO USE
MM-HMM
SO IN THAT CASE WE COULD USE KINETIC UH ENERGY BUT I THINK JUST A SIMPLE BATTERY WHICH YOU CAN RELOAD ON A DOCKING STATION IS JUST AS GOOD
AND MUCH CHEAPER AS WELL
YEAH
SO
AND THAT'S THE BEST CHOICE
OKAY LET ME JUST CHOOSE FOR THE BATTERY
THAT BRINGS US TO THE CHIP
SO IT'S GOTTA BE ADVANCED
WELL THERE ISN'T ANY CHOICE THERE BECAUSE WE'RE USING THE THE THE THE DISPLAY
JUST THE ADVANCED
OKAY ADVANCED CHIP
'KAY
OR BOTH
UM WHICH BRINGS US A LITTLE BIT BACK TO MARKETING AS WELL
AND THEN WE GET TO THE POINT OF THE CASE
UH IF WE WANNA CHOOSE FOR WOOD OR THE BLACK AND GREY
UM BUT I THINK IT WILL ATTRACT ELDERLY PEOPLE WHO WANNA HAVE SOMETHING EXCLUSIVE WHICH THEY CAN SHOW OFF TO THEIR GRANDKIDS
LOOK I'VE GOT A NEW REMOTE CONTROL AND UH
UM AS WE SAW THERE IS NOT YEAH WOOD IS A LOT MORE EXPENSIVE TO PRODUCE
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
SO IT WOULDN'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO BE WOOD IF IT'S JUST
WELL AND I THINK MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR THERE IS THE WOODEN COLOUR
UH I DUNNO
YEAH
THAT'S RIGHT
WOOD COLOURED
MM
OR
BUT WITH COLOUR WAS A LOT MORE EXPENSIVE
I'LL HAVE TO UH RESEARCH
MM I DUNNO
YOU DON'T KNOW
I THINK SO BECAUSE YEAH
IT'S A LOT MORE DIFFICULT TO TO HANDLE AND TO TO GET IN THE RIGHT SHAPE
PROBABLY
MM
UH IS IT POSSIBLE UH TO MAKE UM CHANGEABLE UH CASE
SO UM UH YOU 'CAUSE UH YEAH WITH UH MOBILE PHONES UH UH SO UH LIKE THE NOKIA MOBILE PHONES UH WHEN YOU CAN CHANGE THE CASE OF IT
SO
YEAH
CHANGE THE CASES
YEAH
MAYBE IT'S POSSIBLE UH POSSIBILITY
SO UM UM YOU HAVE JUST TO MAKE ONE UM STANDARD UM REMOTE CONTROL AND UM YEAH YOU CAN SELL UH FEW UH YEAH
YOU CAN SELL THE CASES
BECAUSE UM THEN YOU CAN ADVERTISE AS WELL WITH THE GIVE YOUR GRANDFATHER A NEW CASE FOR HIS REMOTE CONTROL OR WHATEVER
I THINK THAT'S A VERY GOOD OPTION
YEAH
YEAH
SO AND THEN YOU CAN MAKE THEM WITH COLOUR
BECAUSE THAT'S A IT'S SOMETHING EXTRA IT'S SOMETHING OTHER REMOTES DON'T HAVE WHICH WE CAN GET A GREAT ADVANTAGE POINT
BLACK AND GREY OTHER COLOURS AS WELL
YEAH
YEAH THAT IS TRUE
YEAH
YEAH
WE WOULD HAVE TO LOOK CAREFULLY INTO THE DESIGN THOUGH
COSTS
'CAUSE WE WOULD HAVE TO MAKE ONE W UH CONTROL WHICH WOULD FIT IN WITH A WOODEN COVER AND A
THE MORE ORIGINAL ONE OR THE MORE STANDARD ONE
PLASTIC COVER
YEAH
YEAH
SO YOU SUGGEST WE SHOULD DESIGN TWO DIFFERENT TELEPHONES
SO THAT WOULD
ON WHICH YOU CAN APPLY YEAH REMOTE CONTROLS ON WHICH YOU CAN APPLY DIFFERENT CASE COVERS FOR EXAMPLE
WELL I WOULDN'T DESIGN A TELEPHONE BUT
WELL NO I THINK W WE SHOULD JUST WE SHOULD THEN JUST DESIGN ONE UM
REMOTE
ONE REMOTE BUT IT WOULD HAVE TO BE FANCY WITH EITHER THE WOOD COVER OR THE PLASTIC ONE
YEAH
OKAY
SO BUT THAT SHOULDN'T BE TOO MUCH OF A PROBLEM
SO EVERYBODY'S OKAY WITH THE CHANGING COVERS
YES
I THINK THAT'S A GOOD UH GOOD OPTION
YEAH
CHANGING CASE COVERS
UM I HEARD OUR INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER TALK ABOUT UH FLAT SINGLE AND DOUBLE CURVED
COULD YOU EXPLAIN THAT A LITTLE MORE
YES
YEAH
WELL THE THE GENERAL LIKE MOST OLDER REMOTES ARE FLAT JUST STRAIGHT
AND UH OUR D MANUFACTURING DEPARTMENT CAN ALSO DELIVER SINGLE CURVED OR DOUBLE CURVED CA CURVED CASES
MM-HMM
AND WHAT WOULD SINGLE CURVED AND DOUBLE CURVED MEAN
SO IT'S J REALLY JUST UP TO THE DESIGN DEPARTMENT WHAT WE'RE GONNA USE
IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER FOR THE PRICE OR THE FUNCTIONALITY
UM IT WOULD JUST ONLY AFFECT THE FORM FOR AS FAR AS I KNOW
OKAY
SO WE CAN PRETTY MUCH JUST DO WHATEVER WE WANT
PICK ONE YOU LIKE YES
OKAY
MM
'KAY
THAT'S GOOD
UH BUT THE FORM HAS TO BE UM IT HAS TO
OR JUST ONLY TO LIE DOWN
IT'S HAS TO BE POSSIBLE TO STAND UP
NO JUST TO LIE DOWN
OKAY
AND THE THE COVER OF THE THE DOCKING STATION IS ALSO
WE'LL GO FOR THAT
ON TOP OF THE TELEVISION THEN
OR NOT
WELL OR BESIDES IT
WHAT TYPE OF INTERFACE DO WE WANT TO USE
AND YOU CAN JUST YEAH THEN CLICK IT IN
THAT'S OKAY
UM SO THE INTERFACE
UM MAYBE YOU CAN MAKE A LITTLE DRAWING OF IT ON THE
MM-HMM
ON THE THE BOARD
DOES SOMEBODY HAVE IDEAS FOR A FORM OR
MM
UH WE CAN JUST USE THE REGULAR FORM OF IT BUT IT'S UM NOT QUITE UH FANCY
SO UM
YEAH
SO THAT WOULD BE GREAT FOR THAT
SO YOUR THUMB WOULD BE EASILY WELL UH I THINK THAT WAS A VERY GOOD POINT 'CAUSE I POINTED OUT EARLIER THAT A LOT OF REMOTES CAUSE R. S. I.
UM YOU UH SAID YOU WANTED TO PUT THE UM CHANGING CHANNELS BUTTON ON THE RIGHT SIDE SO YOU COULD
UM I THOUGHT MAYBE WE COULD JUST MAKE ONE OF THOSE BUTTONS ON BOTH THE LEFT AND THE RIGHT SIDE
YEAH
YEAH
FOR UH UH FOR YEAH YEAH
FOR LEFT HANDED USERS ALSO
YEP
MM
YEAH WE UM
OR OR ISN'T IT
IS IT POSSIBLE TO UM PROGRAM IT S SO UH YOU GOT ON THE LEFT SIDE UH OR ON THE RIGHT SIDE UH BUTTONS FOR FOR SHIFTING U UP AND SHIFTING UP
AND ON THE UH OTHER UH UH O OTHER SIDE UH BUTTONS FOR UH SHIFTING UH FOR FOR THE SOUND
UM WELL THAT COULD
FOR THE VOLUME
MM
YEAH WE COULD DO THAT BUT I'M NOT SURE IF THAT WOULD BE VERY GOOD FOR THE EASY EASE OF USE
USABILI YEAH EASE OF USE WILL BE A LOT MORE DIFFICULT AND THEN IT'S
YEAH OKAY
UH
BUT IF WE WOULD MAKE UM A CHANGING CHANNELS AND CHANGING VOLUME BUTTON ON BOTH SIDES THAT WOULD CERTAINLY YIELD GREAT OPTIONS FOR THE DESIGN OF THE REMOTE
MM
'CAUSE IT COULD BE MADE ALL SYMMETRICAL AND STUFF
YEAH BUT
SO PEOPLE CAN GET CONFUSED
BUT YOU HAVE EXTRA BUTTONS
YEAH
YEAH
THAT IS TRUE
YEAH
ESPECIALLY IF THEY HAVE THE SAME WRITINGS ON IT
OR WE HAVE TO MAKE A LEFT UH FOR LEFTIES AND
SEE UM YEAH
CAN'T WE MAKE UH CAN'T WE MAKE A REMOTE WHICH YOU CAN FLIP OVER AND USE
ON THE SAME
UM
FUNCTIONS AS THE NORMAL ONE
YOU MEAN UM
THEN YOU HAVE TO
YEAH IF
LET'S SEE IF I CA
A BLANK ONE
AND THEN YOU GET
HERE'S A LITTLE L. C. D. SCREEN
UH NOW I HAVE TO THINK
IT'S A PLUS AND A MIN
NO IT'S NOT VERY HANDY I THINK
BECAUSE THE PLUS AND THE MIN WILL BE OPPOSITE AND ALL KINDS OF
MM NO
YEAH
YEAH
NO THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK
BUT IS IT A PROBLEM THAT LEFT HANDED PERSONS USE A DIFFERENT HAND
I GUESS
MAYBE WE SHOULD YEAH
I THINK THE FUNCTIONS ARE
UM
THAT BASIC THAT NOBODY SHOULD HAVE ANY PROBLEMS WITH UH CHOOSING A CHANNEL OR
THAT IS TRUE
YEAH
YEAH
IT'S JUST UH U USING UH YOUR THUMB
SO UM IT'S
Y YEAH
I THINK WE COULD JUST UH LEAVE IT A NORMAL SHAPE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
UH BUT MAYBE WE HAVE TO
MAKE IT A L A BIT MORE FANCY
IN ONE OR ANO ANOTHER WAY
UM
YEAH
BECAUSE THAT'S THE BASIS YOU'RE BUILDING ON
I THINK WE SHOULD START BY BY CHOOSING A CASE
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
UM YEAH JUST
SO I COULD DRAW THEM OUT
LET'S LOOK AT THE FLAT CASE
OH
THE THE SINGLE CURVED SO I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT THEY'RE GONNA LOOK LIKE BUT I THINK IT'S SOMETHING LIKE THIS
IT'S FROM THE SIDE SO IT'S RATHER NORMAL
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
SO THIS TYPE SHOULD BE BETTER FOR YOU OR BETTER SHOULD PREVENT REPETITIVE STRAIN INJURY A BIT
EASIER
AND THE DOUBLE CURVED S LOOKS SOMETHING LIKE THIS I GUESS
MM
SO TH THOSE ARE THE THREE OPTIONS WE HAVE
I SUGGEST UM THE SINGLE CURVED BECAUSE MAYBE THE CURVE IS PRETTY GOOD TO PUT THE THE SCREEN IN
BECAUSE IT'S A BIT IT HAS A BIT OF A ANGLE
UH SO THAT ELDERLY PEOPLE CAN UH USE THE REMOTE CONTROL AND AT THE SAME TIME LOOK EASILY AT THE SCREEN
'KAY
MM
SO UM
DO YOU SAY THIS UM
S UH
UH YOU GOT LIKE UH SORT OF A I BELIEVE THERE
MM-HMM
OR NOT
SO UM YOU WANT TO PUT A DISPLAY OVER HERE
YEAH
I THINK SO
YEAH
YEAH
UM
UM MAYBE IT'S POSSIBLE TO UH MAKE THIS SIDE LIKE UM LET'S SEE
THAT'S THE TOP
UH WE CAN MAKE IT UM MM
UM
YEAH
SO UH THIS TOP
THIS DOWN
BUT NOW IT'S
DO YOU HAVE IT UPSIDE DOWN OR DO YOU HAVE IT THIS THAT'S TOP
OKAY
COLOUR UH OKAY
UH TO MAKE THIS SIDE UM LIKE MM
UM BIT LIKE SO UH UM IN THE FORM OF YOUR HAND
THE RIGHT COLOUR
SO UM
UH IT'S AN
YEAH
SO UH IT'S POSSIB UM YEAH FOR S SO AND
SO SO THE REMOTE CONTROL HAVE TO UM LAY IN YOUR HAND
SO GET YOUR MOUSE
YEAH
AND TO PUT UH THE THE BUTTONS FOR UM
CHANGING UH THE CHANNEL UH OVER HERE UH
YEAH
BUT I THINK IT'S BETTER TO PUT THE SCREEN UH ON TOP
THAT'S A GOOD ONE
YEAH
YEAH
UH REM
AND THEN FLIP IT UPSIDE DOWN
IF YOU CAN HAVE THIS ONE YOU TURN IT LIKE THIS
SO JUST FLIP IT A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DEGREES AROUND THEN YOU GET HERE
YEAH BUT THIS PLACE UM
UH IT'S YEAH I DUNNO UM
BECAUSE UH MAYBE YOUR HAND IS IN THE WAY IF YOU HAVE THE DISPLAY HERE
YEAH
MM-HMM
IT'S MORE LOGICAL TO HAVE IT ON TOP AS WELL BECAUSE LIKE ON YOUR MOBILE PHONE IT'S ALWAYS ABOVE
I THINK I
YEAH SO
YEAH
ON TOP
SO
YEAH
OH MAYBE YOU SHOULD JUST S START ON A BLANK PAGE
SO THEN WE GET
YEAH
HERE'S THAT'S THE CURVE
FIVE MINUTES
JUST THAT'S FOR LEFT HAND AND RIGHT HAND USERS
HERE THE DISPLAY AND THEN BUTTONS
YEAH AND THEN WE CAN HAVE A LITTLE BIT OFF HERE AND HERE MAYBE
YEAH
MM-HMM
AND THEN H THE REST OF THE BUTTONS OVER HERE
YEAH
BUT UM THE ON OFF BUTTON UM STILL ON THE TOP UH YEAH
YEAH STILL HERE JUS
YEAH
THAT'S
AND I'D PREFER THE CORNERS TO BE ROUND
YEAH
'KAY
YEAH
THINK THAT WOULD BE BETTER
SHOULD BE MORE BIT MORE FRIENDLY YEAH
FRIENDLY ON THE EYE
'KAY
SUPPLEMENTS
THAT'S OKAY
WHERE'S MY MOUSE
THEN
SO CHECK OUT THE CORPORATE WEBSITE MAYBE
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE CORPORATE DESIGN IMAGE UH IS GOING TO BE IN THE REMOTE
SO NOW FOR THE NEXT MEETING UH WE'LL HAVE TO LOOK AT THE LOOK AND FEEL DESIGN
WE'VE GOT A GENERAL IDEA OF THE CONCEPTS AND THE MATERIALS WE'RE GOING TO USE
AND PRODUCT EVALUATION
THE USER INTERFACE DESIGN IT'S THE SAME STORY
BUT YOU'RE GOING TO GET YOUR INSTRUCTIONS I THINK SENDED BY THE COACH
SO THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER AND USER INTERFACE DESIGNER ARE GOING TO WORK TOGETHER ON THIS ONE
SO JUST UM I WILL PUT THESE UM MINUTES ON THE IN THE FOLDER
OKAY
AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO UH TRY TO FINISH OUR PROJECT AND UH MAKE A GOOD DESIGN FOR ALL THE GRANDFATHERS AND GRANDMOTHERS I THINK
WHICH ARE UH LET'S SEE
I'M NOT SURE IF YOU'RE GOING TO START RIGHT AWAY TO WORK TOGETHER OR I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO FILL IN THE QUESTIONNAIRES FIRST
AND THEN YOU'LL GET A MESSAGE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
THEN WE CAN SAVE THIS ONE IN THE
SO THAT'S UH BASICALLY IT
MAYBE THIS ONE
FOLDERS GROUP
SO IF YOU WANNA HAVE A LOOK AT IT IT'S OVER THERE IN THE PROJECTS FOLDER
UH YES IT'S HERE
SMARTBOARD THERE IT IT
YEAH
YEAH
AND THEN I GUESS WE'LL START IN THIRTY MINUTES AGAIN
THANK YOU
VERY GOOD
OKAY
OKAY
SO
HELLO
SORRY I'M A LITTLE LATE
GOT STUCK IN THE TRAFFIC
GOOD AFTERNOON
NO PROBLEM
OUR FOURTH AND LAST MEETING
OKAY
STARTS AT THREE O'CLOCK
THAT'S POSSIBLE ON UH THIS TIME OF DAY
UH UH LET ME SEE
YEAH
THERE HE IS
YES
SO AFTER THIS YOU WILL BE UH FREE TO GO AND UH SPEND ALL YOUR MONEY
AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO CLOSE THE PROJECT TODAY AS WELL
IN THIS MEETING WE WILL DISCUSS OUR FINAL DESIGN
AND WE WILL DO SOME EVALUATION ABOUT THE NOT ONLY THE PRODUCT BUT ALSO THE PROJECT
OKAY THIS OUR LAST MEETING
THE USABILITY INTERFACE DESIGN AND WE WILL DO THE PRODUCT EVALUATION
AND THIS UH DESIGN DETAILED DESIGN MEETING UH WE WILL DISCUSS UH THE LOOK AND FEEL OF THE DESIGN
UM IN ORDER TO DO THAT WE HAVE THIS AGENDA
SO WE HAVE TO SEE IF IT FITS WITHIN THE TWELVE AND A HALF EURO PER REMOTE
UH WE WILL HAVE TO SEE IF EVERYTHING WE WANNA DO IS ALSO POSSIBLE WITHIN OUR BUDGET
THEN WE WILL SET UP SOME EVALUATION CRI UM CRITERIA
WE'LL HAVE THE PROTOTYPE PRESENTATION FIRST
THEN WE WILL LOOK AT THE FINANCE
BECAUSE EVERYTHING COSTS MONEY AND THE MORE FUNCTIONS YOU WANNA HAVE THE MORE MONEY IT WILL COST
THEN WE WILL DO THE PROJECT UH EVALUATION AND THE CLOSING AFTER THAT
WE'VE GOT FORTY MINUTES
SO WE WILL BE FINISHED AT HALF PAST THREE
BUT WE WILL SEE THAT LATER
BUT FIRST UM
WE WILL DO THE THIS IS PROTOTYPE PRESENTATION
SO IF SOME YEAH IF SOMEBODY WANTS STEP FORWARD
OKAY
THE MUTE BUTTON JUST BELOW THAT
THE DEFAULT SPOT FOR THE ON OFF BUTTON
WELL THIS IS WHAT ME AND RICHARD CAME UP WITH
THEN THERE'S THE VOLUME AND CHANNEL SELECTORS
SIMPLE PLUS MINUS BUTTON
IF YOU HOLD IT AND YOU PRESS ANOTHER BUTTON UH THE HELP GOES TO THE L. C. D. SCREEN
UH WE THOUGHT OF A HELP BUTTON
AND THE COMPANY LOGO
A BUTTON FOR THE SUBTITLES
THEN THERE'S THE ZERO TO ONE TO ZERO BUTTONS
A BUTTON FOR TELETEXT
SO IT'S RATHER SIMPLE PROTOTYPE
AND UH WE'LL HAVE TO SEE FROM TESTING UH HOW THE USERS TAKE IT
OKAY
UM IS THIS THE MOMENT WHERE WE ASK OR CAN ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FUNCTIONALITY
SO
SURE UH JUST POP IN AT ANY TIME
YEAH
YEAH
UM WHEN YOU'RE IN TELETEXT THERE USUALLY ARE BUTTONS WHERE YOU JUST YOU JUST PRESS IT AND YOU G GO TO THE NEXT TELETEXT PAGE
UH THAT'S JUST UH THE NORMAL UH AS TH AS THE NORMAL UH REMOTE CONTROLS UH SO UM
NOW YOU CAN USE THE NORMAL UH ONE TO ZERO BUTTONS
AND YOU BUT YOU CAN ALSO UH USE THE UM BUTTON TH FOR UH CHANGING THE THE CHANNEL
YOU PUT IT UH YOU UM CAME IN UH PAGE UH ONE HUNDRED
MM-HMM
SO
UH FOR UH YEAH SHIF SHIFTING UP IN UH ON T ON T UH TELETEXT AND SHIFTING UH DOWN
S SO UH THE SHIFTING UH BUTTON
OKAY
OKAY
UM
YEAH
BUT UH I THINK THESE ARE ALTOGETHER QUITE A QUITE A FEW BUTTONS
UH JUST A FEW BUTTONS AND LARGE BUTTONS
OKAY
UH BUT UM I THOUGHT IN A FEW MEETINGS EARLIER WE UH UH TRIED TO KEEP IT UH SIMPLE
OH YEAH
SO I'M WONDERING IF WE IF WE NEELY REALLY NEED ALL OF THOSE BUTTONS
I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT
AND WELL THE ON OFF BUTTON IT'S IT'S A NECESSITY
YOU CAN'T DROP THAT ONE
MOST CONTROLS THEY'VE GOT MORE BUTTONS THAN THIS
THE VOLUME AND CHANNEL BUTTONS YOU NEED YOU OBVIOUSLY NEED THOSE THOSE
THAT'S RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
THE MUTE BUTTON COULD BE REPLACED UH BY PRESSING THE VOLUME DOWN BUTTON TWICE
I THINK THE HELP BUTTON REALLY IS NECESSARY BECAUSE THERE'S NO OTHER WAY TO KNOW WHEN SOMEONE WANTS TO KNOW WHAT A BUTTON DOES
SO WE COULD CANCEL THAT ONE
YEAH YEAH
MM
BUT UH WE THINK UH OLD PEOPLE UH DON'T KNOW THAT UH OPTION
UH OR YOU CAN BUILD IN UH WHEN YOU PRESS UH ONE BUTTON UH UH YEAH
BUT M YEAH
WE DISC DISCUSS THAT ALREADY
SO UH THEY JUST PUT IN UH PUT PRESS UH THE BUTTON AND UH
YEAH
LONG TIME
IF YOU PUT
YEAH
OKAY
WELL YOU CAN'T
LEAVE OUT THE NUMBER BUTTONS I GUESS
AND UH
OKAY
UH TELETEXT AND SUBTITLES ARE YEAH NECESSARY
YEAH
AND
SO IT'S RATHER BASIC ALREADY
YEAH
OH
YEAH
IF YOU JUST MAKE A CONTROL FOR JUST THE T. V. THERE'S JUST NOT MUCH TO GAIN HERE
YEAH
THAT'S WHAT I POINTED OUT EARLIER
THINK SO
YEAH
YEP
OKAY
SO WE HAD SOMEBODY ABOUT TH INTERFA SOMETHING ABOUT THE DESIGN OF THE BUTTONS THERE
JUST FOR RECOGNITION
YEAH THEY'RE IT'S RATHER HARD TO DRAW ON THE WHITE BOARD
BUT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE EQUAL SIZED ROUND WITH A WITH A LITTLE LOGO ON IT FOR THE FOR THE VOLUME THE THE TRIANGLE AND STUFF
YEAH IT
YEAH
JUST N NORMAL PLAIN BUTTONS
YEAH YEAH
JUST TO RECOGNISE IT SO UH
YEAH
'KAY
UH YEAH AND NOW WE DON'T NEED UH LEDS OR UM
NO
UH SO
Y UH S SOME UH REMOTE CONTROLS UH DO IT ALSO BUT UM UH BECAUSE WE USE THE LITTLE DISPLAY WE DON'T UH HAVE TO USE IT
NO
YEAH
OKAY
SO AND FOR THE MATERIALS WE'VE JUST CHOSEN FOR RUBBER BUTTONS
SO THEY JUMP OUT
WITH A A DIFFERENT COLOUR THAN THE CASE
NAY
YEP
THAT'S NICE
THEN BECAUSE WE ONLY HAVE THIRTY MINUTES LEFT I WILL MOVE ON TO THE FINANCE PART
AND I CAN TELL YOU
OKAY
WHICH IS PRETTY EXCITING TO SEE IF IT'S ALL POSSIBLE WHAT WE WANNA DO
AND UH THAT'S ABOUT IT
THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A PRETTY HARD TIME PRODUCING THIS FOR TWELVE AND A HALF EUROS
MM
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S POSSIBLE
I COUNTED TWO BATTERIES
BUT MAYBE WE CAN ALSO USE ONE
IF WE SEE I DON'T KNOW IF I'VE FILLED IN CORRECTLY SO JUST CORRECT ME IF YOU SEE UH SOMETHING WRONG
SINCE IT RECHARGEABLE
THAT'S RIGHT
IT'S RECHARGEABLE
YEAH WE CAN U JUST UH
THAT'S TWO EUROS OFF
OKAY
WE NEED THE ADVANCED CHIP
SO THERE'S NOT MUCH TO UH
'KAY
YEP
UH WE CAN SEE THAT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN UNCURVED AND THE SINGLE CURVED IS ONE EURO
HERE WE HAVE THE SINGLE CURVES
TO SAVE THERE
UM
MM
I DON'T KNOW BUT I THINK THE SINGLE CURVED IS GOOD FOR DESIGN AND ALSO FOR THE DISPLAY TO HAVE A PROMINENT PLACE ON THE REMOTE CONTROL
I THINK WE HAVE TO KEEP THAT
YEAH
YES
YEAH
BUT THEN THE BIGGEST COSTS ARE THE BUTTONS
IT'S THE CHEAPEST ONE WE NEED
SO THAT'S UH NOT MUCH TO SAVE EITHER
THEN WE HAVE THE CASE MATERIAL SUPPLEMENTS
IT'S PLASTIC
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO WE WILL HAVE TO GET THE TWELVE AND A HALF EUROS AT THE END
SO MAYBE WE REALLY SHOULD TRY TO DISCARD SOME BUTTONS TO UH KEEP OUR COSTS LOW
UM
OKAY
YEAH
BECAUSE I SIXTEEN
SO IF WE LET'S FIR FIRST COUNT THE BUTTONS WE HAVE NOW
NAH THAT WILL BE EVEN MORE THEN
EIGHTEEN EUROS
UH
SIXTEEN I BELIEVE SO
SO
UH SEVENTEEN
SEVENTEEN
UM
UH WITH THE HELP BUTTON
YEAH
I THINK WE CAN UH DISCARD THE HELP AND THE MUTE BUTTON
OKAY INCLUDING THE HELP
UH SEVENTEEN
YEP
DAMN
YEAH
UH BY PRESSING DOWN VOLUME LONG OR PRESSING DOWN A A NUMBER
YEP
LONG
THAT SAVES US UH ONE EURO ALREADY
'CAUSE THEN WE HAVE GOT FIFTEEN I THINK
YEAH
NO
WOULDN'T YEAH
THAT WOULDN'T BE AN OPTION
FIFTEEN BUTTONS
AND THIS IS
UH D I ASSUME YOU'D COUNT THE VOLUME AND CHANNEL THINGIES FOR TWO BUTTONS EACH RIGHT
NO THOSE ARE ONE I THINK
YEAH
WELL THINK ACTUALLY THERE'RE TWO BUTTONS AREN'T THEY
WHERE DID UH
BUT UM
UH IT'S JUST ONE BUTTON
BUT THEY ARE UH MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE SMALL ONES
UH YEAH
THERE WERE UH TWO UH FOR ONE BIG BUTTON
SO
YEAH
YEAH BUT TH IT'S NOT STATED IN THIS FILES
SO MAYBE WE CAN WE CAN EVEN MAKE ONE BUTTON WITH THE VOLUME AND THE CHANNEL IN ONE BY PRESSING
IT'S JUST A
WELL I WAS THINKING MAYBE YOU COULD JUST INTEGRATE THREE OF THOSE NUMBERS TO ONE BUTTON
THAT'S POSSIBILITY AS WELL
THAT WOULD CUT THE COST
SO YOU CAN MAKE
SO AND IT'S GOOD FOR THE DESIGN AS WELL
IF YOU MAKE THIS
UH LET'S SEE
LOOKS A BIT LIKE UH
A CROSS
MIN
PLUS
BUT I DON'T DON'T KNOW IF IF IT'S CHEAPER
SO UH WE'VE STILL GOT FOUR BUTTONS BUT JUST UM SO
YEAH W
UH S YEAH CHANNEL
YEAH TH I THINK THEY COUNT UH THE MATERIALS
YOU GOT UH NOT NOT A BUTT BUTTON ITSELF BUT UH ON THE UM
YEAH ON THE CHIP THERE
YEAH
YEAH
ON THE CHIP YOU'VE GOT STILL UH FOUR UH FOUR BUTTONS
SO
YEAH
MM-HMM
THAT'S RIGHT
THAT'S RIGHT
YEAH
BUT I THINK BECAUSE WE HAVE THE ADVANCED CHIP WE CAN JUST COUNT THIS AS ONE BUTTON
BUT NO BUT I THINK
YEAH BUT
BUT I THINK THIS REALLY IS FOUR BUTTONS ANYHOW
YES
MAYBE IT IS BUT THEN IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO GET THE TWELVE AND A HALF EUROS
ALSO THE L. C. DISPLAY I THINK IT'S I THINK IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE FOR THE DISPLAY WE USE
YEAH
I THINK THEY UH TRY T
YES
UH THAT'S THAT'S A BIG COST
IF WE LEAVE OUT THE DISPLAY WE CAN ALSO SAVE MONEY ON THE CHIP
THAT'S RIGHT BUT WHAT'S THE BIG ADVANTAGE OF OUR REMOTE THEN
ONLY THE DOCKING STATION I GUESS
YEAH
WHICH ISN'T THE THE DOCKING STATION ISN'T EVEN IN THIS C S SCHEMATIC
THAT'S EXTRA
THAT'S EXTRA
THAT'S RIGHT
NO
SO IT'S NOT EVEN TAKEN INTO THE PRICE
MAYBE WE SHOULD TO A DIFFERENT SUPPLIER
AND INTEGRATE TH UH THESE BUTTONS IN THREE THEN WE SAVE A LOT OF MONEY AS WELL
POLAND
DON'T YOU THINK WE CAN IF WE CAN COUNT THIS AS V AS ONE BUTTON
SOMETHING
THAT'S AN OPTION
POLISH SUPPLIER
YEAH
WE WE COULD SAVE MONEY ON IT
BUT WOULD IT MAKE THE REMOTE MORE USABLE FOR ELDERLY PEOPLE
YEAH THAT'S WHAT I'M WONDERING
MY MOTHER CAN'T EVEN SEND SEND AN S. M. S. MESSAGE
SO
THAT'S A POINT
YEAH
UM
SO UM
ARE WE GONNA BUY A UM A REMOTE CONTROL UH WHEN YOU CAN UH USE IT
YEAH
WE M UH WE MUST UM STAY BELOW THE UM BELOW UM TWELVE UH FIFTY OR CAN'T UH GO UM
YEP
YEAH
NO
WELL SINCE THE MARKET RESEARCH
INDICATED THAT OLDER PEOPLE SPEND THEIR MONEY EASIER MORE EASY MAYBE IT'S FEASIBLE TO JUST PUT THE PRICE OF THE REMOTE UP A LITTLE
ESPECIALLY SINCE WE HAVE THOSE NICE FEATURES
NAY
YEAH
SO
YEAH BUT UH WE HAVE TO STICK TO THE TWELVE AND A HALF EUROS
WE DON'T HAVE ANY MORE BUDGET TO DEVELOP IT
YEAH
THE MARGIN WILL GET TOO SMALL
IS IT IMPOSSIBLE TO
BUT IT IS POSSIBLE TO MAKE ONE UH FOR UH TWELVE FIFTY
I DON'T THINK SO
IT IS
AND IF YOU USE LESS BUTTONS
IF YOU LEAVE OUT THE L. C. DISPLAY
IT WOULD BE A BE A PRETTY RIGID ONE
S
YEAH
SAY OR YOU CAN TAKE THE SINGLE CHIP
TEN
BUT YOU CAN'T USE UH
THERE IT IS
YEAH
BUT WE WANT TO MAKE A
UH SO UH UH FANCY AND A GOOD UH YEAH
BUT THEN W
GOOD LOOKING
UH WI WITH N OH WITH UH
YEAH
SO UH YOU CAN STAY UH BELOW UH TWELVE FIFTY
SO
ATTRACTIVE UH O OPTIONS
I THINK IT'S UH DIFFICULT AS WELL BUT
OR B
BASICALLY BECOMING A CHOICE BETWEEN LIKE EITHER A GOOD REMOTE AND A HIGHER PRODUCTION COST OR JUST ANY OTHER REMOTE CONTROL
NO REMOTE
OR WE CAN LEAVE OUT THE TEN BUTTONS AND TAKE ONE SCROLL WHEEL FOR THE PROGRAMME NUMBERS
SCROLL WHEEL'S ONE
THAT'S
THEN W
BECAUSE THEN WE SAVE TEN BUTTONS
IF WE HAVE THIS ONE AND WE'VE GOT THE ADVANCED
THEN WE HAVE FIVE AND ONE
AND AND SEE
NO IT
YEAH
W UH WE'RE GETTING CLOSE
WE'RE GETTING CLOSER
YEAH
BUT HOW DOES SCROLL WHEEL WORK HERE
THEN YOU WILL
OR MAYBE YOU CAN
UNTIL YOU'VE GOT THE RIGHT NUMBER THEN YOU PUSH IT
IF YOU SCROLL YOU WILL SEE THE NUMBERS ON THE L. C. D. DISPLAY
UM SCROLL
YEAH
THAT WOULD BRING UP THE PRICE OF THE SCROLL WHEEL ALSO
ALRIGHT
OKAY BUT THEN YOU YOU CAN PUSH UH SOME OTHER BUTTON AS WELL
IT'S GOTTA SCROLL AND PUSH
BUT YEAH
INTEGRATED SCROLL WHEEL PUSH BUTTON
MM
YOU COULD JUST NOT SCROLL FOR A HALF A SECOND
THAT'S RIGHT
SO IF YOU SCROLL TO A NUMBER AND THEN YOU WAIT A HALF SECOND THEN IT G TURNS TO THAT CHANNEL
YEAH
SO YOU WON'T NEED A BUTTON
I THINK THAT WOULD BE LIKE THE END OF OUR USABILITY
AND WE NEED THE BATTERY
BUT IT WOULD DEFINITELY CROP COST A LOT
D YEAH
YEAH BUT
IT HAS TO BE ADVANCED
AND THE REGULAR CHIP IS NOT POSSIBLE
IF YOU WANT TO USE AN L. C. D. SCREEN YOU YOU NEED AN ADVANCED CHIP YES
OKAY
AND WE CAN SAVE A EURO BY A FLAT DESIGN
YEAH
IT HAS TO BE ADVANCED
HMM
THAT'S AN OPTION WE CAN THEN WE'RE ALMOST THERE
YEP
JA JA
YEAH IF YOU V COULD JUST LEAVE OUT ONE MORE BUTTON
YEAH
SO IF WE
YEAH OR WE HAVE TO UH SKIP THE SUBTITLE UH BUTTON
YEAH
YEAH BUT I THINK THAT'S THAT IS A BIG ADVANTAGE IF WE'RE
SO YEAH
YEAH IT'S A BIG ADVANTAGE
BUT UM IT'S
BUT
CAN WE USE CAN'T WE INTEGRATE THE TELETEXT AND THE SUBTITLES IN ONE BUTTON
YEAH
I THINK SO
UH YEAH
BUT THE SUBTITLES STAY THERE
WELL THINK IT'S PRETTY MUCH THE TELETEXT SUBTITLES ARE RIGHT NOW YOU JUST PUSH THE TELETEXT BUTTON GO TO PAGE EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT AND TELETEXT DISAPPEARS
IF YOU PUSH IT THREE TIMES
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
BUT IF YOU PUSH THE TELETEXT BUTTON TWICE
I THINK THAT'S THE CASE ON MOST
EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT
WHAT IF YOU HAVE TO SCROLL TO PAGE EIGHTY EIGHT
IT'S UH
ONE M UH ONE B UH A FEW BUTTONS
AH THAT'S NOT REALLY THAT
WELL THAT COULD BE JUST UH LIKE THE SCROLL TO EIGHT CLICK SCROLL TO EIGHT CLICK SCROLL TO EIGHT CLICK
YEAH
OKAY
BUT THEN AGAIN THAT WOULD BE D J JUST PRETTY MUCH NOT AN OPTION FOR OLDER PEOPLE WHO DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT A SCROLL WHEEL IS
NO
YEAH
HOLDING A
NO
REMOTE WITH WHICH THEY EXPECT TO HAVE LIKE TEN BUTTONS FOR THE NUMBERS ONE TO ZERO
WITH ONLY FIVE BUTTONS ON IT
AND A SCROLL WHEEL
I THINK IF YOU MAKE A GOOD ADVERTISEMENT UH ON TELEVISION AND IN THE IN THE GUIDE YOU CAN EXPLAIN TO THE PEOPLE HOW TO USE THE SCROLL WHEEL
IF YOU JUST MAKE IT REAL SIMPLE
BECAUSE IT SAVES IT SAVES A LOT OF MONEY
HOW TO USE THE OTHER BU BUTTONS AS SUBTITLES
HOW TO USE THE SCROLL WHEEL
AND WE CAN KEEP OUR L. C. D. SCREEN WHICH CAN PROVIDE EXTRA INFORMATION
TRUE
TRUE
HMM
IF YOU WOULD ERASE THESE
AND IT'S GOOD FOR THE INNOVATIVE DESIGN AS WELL
MM ERASER
AND WE PUT UH
LOOKS A BIT ODD MAYBE
THAT'S A PRETTY BIG SCROLL WHEEL
THAT IS
ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE BUTTONS IF WE ERASE THIS ONE
THEN YEAH
WE'VE GOT THE SCROLL WHEEL
SOMETHING LIKE THAT
AND THESE ARE TWO BUTTONS THEN
WE COULD MAKE TWO BUTTONS OUT OF THAT
AND JUST UM
IF YOU PRESS THE VOLUME BUTTON YOU CAN CONTROL THE VOLUME WITH THE SCROLL WHEEL
YEAH
SO THAT WOULD SAVE TWO BUTTONS
IF YOU DO THE SAME FOR THE CHANNEL
YEAH
THAT'S REALLY A GOOD GOOD IDEA I THINK
AND IT WILL MAKE THE USE OF THE SCROLL WHEEL UH MORE OBVIOUS INDEED
MORE OBVIOUS
SO WE MAKE ONE FOR THE VOLUME ONE FOR THE CHANNEL
PLUS SCROLL
THAT'S RIGHT
YEAH WE CAN LEAVE THE TELETEXT IN IF WE WANT
SO WE'VE GOT ONE TWO THREE
SO IF WE
YEAH
SO
YEAH
THAT'S M THAT'S BETTER
SO THIS IS FIVE BUTTONS
IF WE LEAVE OUT ALL THOSE BUTTONS PERHAPS YOU CAN GO WITH THE FLAT FLAT CASE
AND MAKE IT SMALLER OVERALL
SO IF YOU PUT THE THE VOLUME AND CHANNEL BUTTONS ON THE SAME HEIGHT AS THE ON OFF BUTTON THE SCREEN RIGHT BEHI UNDER THAT THAN THE SCROLL BUTTON
Y YEAH
MM YEAH
UH YEAH AND THEN YOU CAN
YOU GET A A MUCH SMALLER REMOTE
UH YEAH
THAT'S RIGHT
AND IT
SO WE CAN
SH
DECREASE THIS ONE TO FOUR BUTTONS
YEAH
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE FIVE
IT UH IT'S A BIT UH
BUT UH YOU CAN MAKE A F QUITE A BIG UH REMOTE REMOTE CONTROL FOR UH JUST THE SAME PRICE AS A SMALL ONE
JUST UH YOU ONLY HAVE TO PAY FOR THE DOUBLE CURVED OR SINGLE CURVED
YEAH
THAT'S NO PROBLEM
YEAH
AND SINGLE CURVED YOU HAVE TO HAVE A DIFFERENT UH DIFFERENT MACHINE THAN A FLAT ONE
IT'S UH IT'S MORE THE MOULDS IN WHICH THEY ARE BEING MADE I THINK
AND CASES COME RIGHT OUT OF THE MACHINE
YEAH
SINGLE CURVED IS REALLY EASY TO JUST FILL IN
MM
I THINK THIS IS A REALLY EASY ONE
UM
WHAT DOES EVERYBODY THINK ABOUT A FLAT OR A SINGLE CURVED DESIGN
FREEK WHAT DO YOU THINK
WELL I STILL THINK WE SHOULD GO FOR THE SINGLE CURVE DESIGN
BUT THEN AGAIN
YEAH
YEAH
RICHARD'S ARGUMENT WAS VERY GOOD
BUT SINCE
ALL THESE CHANGES ARE NOT REALLY OKAY WITH ME
YEAH
YEAH
YEP
WE HAVE TO CUT COSTS
YEAH
YEAH I'M AG
WE JUST HAVE TO
YEAH
I'D RATHER JUST GO TO THE BOARD AND
ASK FOR MORE MONEY
GET US TO SPEND EIGHTEEN DOLLARS A A REMOTE
YEAH
I AM AGREEING WITH THE USABILITY
YEAH
YEAH
OR DO SOME MARKET RESEARCH AND SEE WHAT THE OPTIONS ARE
YEAH
BUT TH UM I THINK WE CAN THEN KEEP THE SINGLE CURVED ONE
SO PEOPLE WILL USE IT MORE AND ESPECIALLY FOR THE HELP FUNCTIONS IT WILL BE GOOD IF WE HAVE SCROLL BAR SCROLL BUTTON
IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO HAVE GOOD HELP FUNCTION AS WELL
JUST TO EXPRESS OUR L. C. D. SCREEN A BIT MORE
YEP
YEAH
YEAH
SO THIS IS SCROLL
I THINK IT WAS BETTER TO HAVE THIS PRICE LIST A BIT EARLIER
BEFORE WE WENT ON TO THE TO THE WHOLE DESIGN
YES
DEFINITELY
THE TH
BUT
I'M GLAD WE COULD MAKE A BIT
YEAH
IT'S PRETTY DIFFERENT IF YOU SAW THE LAST ONE THAN THIS ONE
IT'S PRETTY DIFFERENT
BUT THIS IS NOT REALLY LIKE FOR THE GROUP WE WERE MAKING OUR REMOTE
THIS WILL REALLY REQUIRE A LOT OF MARKETING
NO
YEAH
IT WILL
TO GET THIS TO SELL
YEAH
BUT UM
THIS IS NOT FAMILIAR FOR THEM
'CAUSE IF OLDER PEOPLE LIKE FAMILIAR FORMS AND FAMILIAR STUFF
NO BUT I THINK
SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO A LOTTA CONVINCING THEM
I THINK THE MOST
UH THEY CAL ALSO UH BUTTONS LIKE THAT FOR UH CHANGING UH CHANNELS
BUT THEY KNOW THE SCROLL BUTTONS FROM UH OLD RADIOS
SO MAYBE IT'S UH
YEAH
LIKE A OLD OLD BUTTONS
WE CAN LET L WE CAN STICK IT OUT A BIT
THAT'S A GOOD ONE
MAYBE THAT'S RECOGNISABLE FOR THEM AS WELL
THAT'S RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
AND IT'S UH IT'S B UH LESS FRIGHTENING I THINK
SO I'M AFRAID WE HAVE TO MOVE ON
IF THEY SEE THIS DESIGN THEY THINK OH THERE ARE ONLY FIVE BUTTONS AND UH BUT WE WILL SEE
YEAH
THAT'S TRUE
MIGHT UH MIGHT BE CONFUSING TOO
YEAH
THAT'S DEFINITELY RIGHT
ONLY FIVE BUTTONS
THEY'D BE LIKE WHAT
MM-HMM
YEAH
BUT VERY SPECIAL SO UH
I WOULD BUY IT
YEAH
BUT YOU'RE NOT SIXTY
THAT'S RIGHT
NO I DON'T KNOW
I WOULD BUY IT IF I WAS SIX
WHAT IT COSTS UNDER TWELVE AND A HALF EUROS
NO
UH YES THEY ARE
NO
BUT WE CAN GO ON WITH THE PROJECT EVALUATION
NO
MM-HMM
I CAN SIT DOWN I THINK
LET'S SEE
WE STILL HAVE FIFTEEN MINUTES LEFT SO WE'RE NICE ON SCHEDULE
YEAH
UM THE PROJECT PROCESS
SO UM I LIKE SET UP ALL THESE CRITERIA
AND EVALUATION OF THE
THAT'S RIGHT
EVALUATION CRITERIA
THAT WAS THE THE POINT I FORGOT
THINGY
I SHOULD
EVALUATION CRITERIA
NO WE'VE GOT FIFTEEN MINUTES BUT
WE'VE GOT FIVE MINUTES I THINK FOR THOSE CRITERIA
THERE WE ARE
GO AHEAD
THANK YOU
FIVE MORE MINUTES
OKAY
UH YES
WHAT
'KAY SO I DID SOME LITERATURE STUDY STUDY AND ANALYSIS OF THE REQUIREMENTS WE SET UP EARLIER
UH YEAH
UM IS THE REMOTE FANCY
THE SHAPE LOOK AND FEEL
TRANSLATED IT INTO CRITERIA WHICH WOULD BE THESE
WHAT NEW FUNCTIONS ARE THERE
INNOVATIVE
UH EASY TO USE
AND ARE THE THOSE FUNCTIONS THAT ARE THERE ARE THEY USEFUL
AND THE COST
UH IS IT FUNCTIONAL
UH LEARNABILITY IS A VERY IMPORTANT FACTOR HERE
ARE THERE NOT TOO MANY FUNCTIONS UH AMONG THE FUNCTIONS
AND RECOGNABILITY
IF OUR COMPANY IS IF IT IS EASILY RECOGNISABLE THAT OUR COMPANY MADE IT
IS THE REMOTE REALLY FOR THE GROUP WE'RE MAKING IT FOR
THE TARGET GROUP
AND
SO WE'RE SUPPOSED TO EVALUATE IT RIGHT NOW
OKAY
LET'S SEE
OH I HAVE TO SAY THIS WAS A LITTLE HARD BECAUSE THE MINUTES OF OUR LAST MEETING
WERE NOT HERE
I TRIED TO BUT IT'S UH IT'S GIVING ERRORS BY DOWNLOADING THE SOFTWARE
YEAH THAT'S BECAUSE MY PEN FAILED TO UPLOAD HIS DATA
MM
OKAY
YEAH
INTERESTING
SO
MM
'KAY
IS THE DESIGN FANCY ON A SCALE OF ONE TO SEVEN
I THINK IT'S FANCY
SIX
YEAH
UH SIX
YEAH
WE ALL GO FOR SIX
GOOD
SIX
UM IS THE DESIGN INNOVATIVE
VERY
SUBTITLES BUTTONS
SO WE'VE GOT TWENTY CENTS FOR OUR DOCKING STATION HUH
YEAH
SEVEN
YEAH
SH
MM
I THINK SO WITH OUR L. C. D. SCREEN DOCKING STATION SCROLL BUTTONS
YEAH
SEVEN
YEAH
IS THE DESIGN EASY TO USE
SHOULD BE DO ABLE
YEAH
THAT'S RIGHT
MM
NOT REALLY
THAT'S A BIT DODGY
WELL
BUT
WOULD BE FOR US
FOR OLD PEOPLE I I
BETWEEN FOUR OR FIVE
FOUR OR FIVE BETWEEN
I WOULD SAY FOUR
FOUR OR FIVE
YES
W YEAH
FOUR
I'D GO FOR FOUR TOO
YEAH
YEAH
IS IT FUNCTIONAL
IS THE DESIGN FUNCTIONAL
UM DO WE HAVE ALL FUNCTIONS THAT WE WANT TO INCLUDE
YES
N YEAH
I THINK WE DO
I DON'T THINK SO
DO WE HAVE TOO MANY FUNCTIONS
IT'S PRETTY SLIM
NO
NO
NO
THINK IT'S UH SEVEN
SEVEN
OH AND DO WE UM
TAKE CARE OF THE BIGGEST FRUSTRATIONS OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
LIKE IT GETTING LOST AND
MM M
R. S. I. INFLUENCES
THINK WE DO
MM WE HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF THAT ONE
I HAD THEM WORKED OUT
IT WAS
MM
THEY ARE UGLY NOT VERY FUNCTIONAL AND GETTING LOST
ARE THE PRODUCTION COSTS WITHIN THE PRESET LIMITS
WELL THEY ARE NOW
YEAH
YEAH
DOES THE DESIGN FIT THE GROUP OF FOCUS
I THINK THAT'S A THREE
MM TH YEAH
I THINK IT DOESN'T
YEAH
NO I THINK WITH OUR NEW RADIO BUTTON I THINK IT'S UH
YEAH
UH
I THINK IT'S BETTER
WE HAVE TO TEST IT S BUT
I DON'T KNOW
I STILL I THINK IT'S TOO M TOO FANCY
TOO TOO FLASHY
I THINK
I THINK IT
I THINK A RADIO BUTTON IS NOT EXACTLY WHAT OLDER PEOPLE EXPECT TO HAVE A REMOTE CONTROL
UH YEAH TRUE
YEAH
I WOULD GIVE IT A FOUR
I THINK I'D GO FOR TWO
I'M NOT SURE
I GO FOR THREE
SO
IT'S THE
THEN WE HAVE TO DO THE THREE
'KAY
IS THE COMPANY COMPANY RECOGNISABLE
WELL WE HAVE THE LOGO THERE
YES IT IS
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
SO
AND THEY WANNA PUT FASHION IN THEIR PRODUCTS
AND WE HAVE THE REMOVABLE FRONT CASES
SO I THINK IT'S VERY RECOGNISABLE
YEP
UH IN THE SLOGAN OF THE COMPANY
YEAH
YEAH
SO THAT WILL BE THIS
I WAS ALSO SUPPOSED TO CALCULATE THE SCORE BUT
THOUGHT WE WOULD HAVE ANOTHER PRIVATE THINGY AFTER THIS
WE'VE GOT A CALCULATE IT
MM
TWENDAG SIEVEN AN TWENDAG
IS THIS LIKE AFTER THIS ARE WE DONE
OR
N WE'VE GONNA WE'RE GOING TO EVALUATE IT
WE'RE GONNA GO TO OUR OTHER ROOM AGAIN
THESE ARE SEVEN FACTORS TIMES SEVEN IS FORTY
WELL ANYHOW
SOMETHING
TWO
NO
NINE
FORTY NINE
UH MINUS ONE
MINUS THREE MINUS FOUR
MINUS FOUR
SO THAT WOULD BE MINUS EIGHT
FORTY ONE OUT OF FORTY NINE
FORTY ONE
THAT'S
AROUND EIGHTY PERCENT
WHAT IS IT
OKAY
GUESS I'LL JUST TYPE THAT IN ON THE BOTTOM HERE
THAT'S EIGHTY FOUR PERCENT
I THINK THAT'S A PRETTY NICE SCORE
HMM
YEAH
YEAH
SO THAT WILL BE THE EVALUATION
HMM
'KAY
OKAY
THANK YOU
SO
THAT BRINGS US TO THE PROJECT EVALUATION
YEP
PROJECT PROCESS
ALONG THE PROCESS
DID WE MOVE THROUGH THE RIGHT PHASES YOU THINK
THANK YOU
YES
BUT IT
YEAH
THINK WE SHOULD HAVE A SHOULD HAVE HAD THE FINANCE THINGY A LOT EARLIER
YEAH
THAT'S RIGHT
IN THE DESIGN PHASE
SO LACK OF INFORMATION ABOUT PRICES
YEAH
THAT'S TRUE
YEAH
YEAH
DEFINITELY
OKAY
UH
OKAY
SATISFACTION
WAS THERE ROOM FOR CREATIVITY
NO
YEAH
IT'S BECAUSE OF THE FINANCE SHEET
NO
NOT TOO MUCH
NO
YEAH
YEAH THERE W THERE WAS ENOUGH ROOM BUT THE FINANCE UH
YEAH TRUE
BUT
THE ROOM WAS YEAH
YEAH
AND I WOULD'VE LIKED TO GO FOR THE
YOUNGER USERS ALSO
AND JUST TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS INTERNET AND
GET SOMETHING OF YOUR OWN
MM
RESTRICTIONS
INTERNET ACCESS
'KAY
LEADERSHIP
WAS IT CLEAR WHAT EVERYBODY HAD TO DO UH ACCORDING TO THEIR ROLES AND FUNCTIONS
YES
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
DID IT WORK OUT
TEAMWORK
WORKING TOGETHER
ALSO YOU TWO OF YOU WITH THE UH LAST PHASE
SO
YES WAS OKAY
YEAH
NICE
THE TASKS ARE VERY STRUCTURED SO YOU CAN JUST DO STEP BY STEP AND IT'S VERY EASY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
TASKS
OKAY
OR WERE THEY TOO MUCH
WERE THE MEANS SUFFICIENT FOR THE TASKS UH WE HAD TO DO
WELL THE SMART BOARD THE D D DRAWING IS JUST A PAIN IN THE ASS BUT
MM
SMART BOARD
THE DIGITAL THE DIGITAL PEN IS VERY NICE
YEAH
IF IT WANTS TO DOWNLOAD ITS UH DATA
YEAH
YEAH
BUT
YEAH
YES
UH
FAILED DOWNLOAD
SMART BOARD WAS IRRITATING
OR SOMETHING ELSE
SO YOU RATHER WANTED TO HAVE A FLIP OVER
A FLIP OVER OR A MORE PRECISE UH
A FLIPPER'S UH EASIER SO
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
FASTER AS WELL I THINK
DIGIT YES
FLIP OVER
OR UH UH IN SHARED F UH FOLDER OR UH SH UH SHARED DIRECTORY
BUT IF YOU WANT TO SHARE UH OF UH WHEN YOU MAKE UM A PICTURE LIKE THIS UH ON THE PRESENTATION
SO
UH SO UH YOU CAN SH SAVE IT UH AND UH PUT IT ON THE INTERNET
IT'S EASIER TO UH SHARE IT WITH UH OTHER PEOPLE
YEAH
YEAH I TRIED TO OPEN THE FILE ON MY LAPTOP BUT
SO YEAH
NO
NO
DIDN'T WORK
NOT POSSIBLE
UH YOU NEED A SMART BOARD UH APPLICATION I THINK
YEAH
T CAN UH CAN YOU EXPORT IT UH LIKE A YEAH
YEAH YOU CAN EXPORT IT AS IMAGE
SHOULD BE POSSIBLE
BUT I THINK YOU CAN YEAH
NO
MUST YEAH MUST BE
SHOULD'VE DONE THAT THEN
SO THE SHARING OF THE INFORMATION WAS UH WAS OKAY
PEN IS HERE
YES
YEAH PEN IS HERE ON THE TABLE
UH NETWORK
UH
UH YEAH
SO YOU CAN UH
YEAH
IT'S POSSIBLE
YEAH
MM
IT'S POSSIBLE
OKAY
OKAY
HAVE WE FOUND NEW IDEAS FOR
THAT'S NICE
OR
HAVING THIS KIND OF MEETINGS
UM YEAH MAYBE UM UH WHEN WE N UH JUST UH GIVE THE NUMBERS OF OF UH
UH UH O ONE OF UH OUT OF S UH SEV UM IT'S UH EASIER TO UH TO DO THE TH THINGS THAT ARE LIKE THAT ON A COMPUTER
UH SO UH JUST L UH LIKE UH AT U UNIVERSITY UH
YEAH
YEAH
SO
YEAH
AND THEN IT MEDIATES THE SCORE AND YOU CAN GET ONE YEAH
SO EVERYBODY PUTS HIS OWN SCORE
THAT'S BETTER
SO THAT'S UH
SO
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
HOW DO WE CALL
EVALUATION
CRITERIA
OKAY
OR QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PROJECT
OR ABOUT THE PRODUCT
MM ANY MORE IDEAS
MM
BECAUSE I THINK
THEN THAT WE GET TO OUR LAST SHEET
ARE THE COSTS WITHIN THE BUDGET
MM YEAH
YEAH
THEY ARE
CONSIDERING WE ARE NOT GOING TO MAKE A DOCKING STATION
DO WE
BUT MAYBE BECAUSE OF THE DOCKING STATION THE PRICE OF THE REMOTE CAN ALSO BE A LITTLE BIT HIGHER
DOCKING STATION
THAT'S A GOOD POINT
YEAH
UH AND I THINK YOU CAN COMPENSATE THAT AS WELL
PERHAPS
MM
SO I THINK THAT SHOULDN'T BE THE BIGGEST PROBLEM BECAUSE IT'S VERY CHEAP TO MAKE AS WELL
MM-HMM
YEAH
IT'S INNOVATIVE
PEOPLE ARE PRETTY DECADENT
OR WHAT WAS IT
IF WE GONNA EXPORT THIS PRODUCT
ESPECIALLY IN AMERICA
FIFTEEN FIFTEEN MILLION
DO WE THINK WE GONNA GET THE TWELVE AND A HALF MILLION
I THINK WE WILL
FIFTY GRAND
YEAH
YEAH
MM
SOMETIMES
YEAH STILL I THINK I MEAN IF WE'RE N GONNA MAKE A SCROLL BUTTON ANYWAY
YEAH
YOU CAN DO MORE
IT'D BE MORE FOR THE YOUNGER PEOPLE THAN FOR THE OLDER PEOPLE
SO MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST RE FOCUS
YEAH
AH
SEE HOW IT WORKS
JUST PUT IT ON THE MARKET FOR EVERYBODY
JUST AS A TEST
YOU CAN YOU CAN CHANGE MARKETS WHERE BY CHANGING THE FRONT COVERS
THAT'S ONE THING YOU CAN CHANGE IT WITH
SO YOU CAN ALSO TRY TO UH REACH THE YOUNGER PEOPLE BY UH PUTTING FANCY COVERS ON ON THE MARKET
THAT'S I THINK A GOOD ADVANTAGE
AH
OR SPECIFICALLY FOR YOUNGER PEOPLE
AH
THAT'S TRUE
YEAH I THINK THEN IT WOULD BE WAY MORE UH POPULAR WITH YOUNGER PEOPLE THAN IT IS THAN WOULD BE WITH
OLDER PEOPLE
YEAH
EVEN IF IT WERE THEIR COVERS
HMM
UH UH THEN I THINK WE CAN HAVE OUR LITTLE CELEBRATION RIGHT NOW
BUT
PARTY PARTY
YEAH
I THINK WE STILL HAVE TO FIT IN ONE MORE QUESTIONNAIRE
I DIDN'T GET A MESSAGE
I THINK
THAT'S IT
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE'S THE CHAMPAGNE
'KAY
FROM THE FROM ENDING OF THE OH I THINK I HAVE ONE NOW
FIVE MORE MINUTES
OH THAT'S NICE
UH I BELIEVE Y UH
OH YOU DID
OKAY
THEN WE STILL HAVE SOME QUESTIONS
IF SOMEBODY HAS SOME QUESTIONS THEY CAN ASK THEM NOW
OR WE CAN PUT THESE IN THE PROJECT FOLDER AS WELL
MAYBE THAT'S
MM-HMM
YEAH
EXPORT AS PICTURE I THINK
YEAH
YEAH
THIS IS ANOTHER NETWORK I GUESS
HMM
I DON'T
DOES SOMEBODY SEE THE PROJECT FOLDER
HMM
MY DOCUMENTS
SO UH
UH MAYBE UH THEY WILL SAVE IT
YEAH I'LL JUST PUT IT IN MY DOCUMENTS AND UH THAT'S OKAY
YEAH IT PROBABLY WILL
OKAY
I THINK I'M GOING TO MAKE OUR FINAL PRESENTATION NOW
OH YEAH YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO MAKE A FINAL
AND THEN I WILL BE BACK IN ABOUT TEN MINUTES TO SHOW YOU THE FINAL PRESENTATION
OKAY
OKAY
SUMMARY OF THE PROJECT
ARE WE SUPPOSED TO GO INTO OUR OWN ROOMS AGAIN
SO UH
UH MAYBE WE HAVE TO FILL UH ANOTHER QUESTIONNAIRE
AND THEN I'LL MEET YOU IN I THINK ABOUT TEN MINUTES OR SOMETHING
I THINK YOU ALL GET A QUESTIONNAIRE IN IN YOUR ROOM
THANK YOU
OKAY
QUESTIONNAIRE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
HOPEFULLY MY PEN WILL DOWNLOAD ITS SOFTWARE
YEAH
OH
OR DATA
THAT'D BE NICE
FUNKY SH STUFF LIKE THAT
YEAH
WONDER HOW MUCH OF THE MEETINGS IS TALKING ABOUT THE STUFF AT THE MEETINGS
YEAH EXACTLY YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
RIGHT
LOOK AT ALL THIS STUFF MAN
OKAY
SO WHAT DO WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT
SHOULD WE
HAS ANYBODY
WELL SHOULD WE JUST GO AROUND AND EVERYONE SAYS WHAT THEY D WHAT THEY'VE BEEN DOING HOW FAR THEY'VE GOT
WELL I HOPE SO
HAS ANYBODY DONE ANYTHING
NO
NOT A LOT
SOUNDS LIKE YOU'VE DONE SOME STUFF
SO
HMM
OKAY
YEAH
YOU BETTER START
ALREADY GONE
WELL I'VE GOT A BROWSER NOW WHICH WHOOPS
OKAY
UH
YEAH
'KAY
GOOD START
THIS WASN'T A GOOD START
OH I DON'T MIND AS WELL
MM-HMM
YEAH
GOOD AT THIS
YEAH
OKAY
SORRY
OKAY
SO YEAH
WE'VE GO A BROWSER WE'VE UM WHICH COMES UP AUTOMATICALLY WITH A TRANSCRIPTION BOX AND THE TOPICS
AND THEN WHEN YOU GO ON THE MENU YOU CAN SELECT A SUMMARISATION BOX WHICH POPS UP AND AN AUDIO PLAYER
RIGHT
YOU HAVE TO EITHER OPEN OPEN A PARTICULAR OBSERVATION OR DO A SEARCH AND OPEN IT THROUGH THAT
AND IT LOADS UP UM JUST THE BACKGROUND WINDOW IS EMPTY AND UM SO WHEN YOU START
UM AND A S I THINK THE SEARCH WORKS AS WELL SO YOU COULD POP UP A SEARCH
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE
UM NOW I WONDER WH HOW WE WANNA DO YOU KNOW WE WANT A POP UP WINDOW WITH THE SPEAKER CHARACTERISATION
UM THE TRANSCRIPTION BOX HAS GOT A SUMMARISE BUT BUTTON WHICH DOESN'T DO ANYTHING YET
THE PROBLEM IS THE R THE LEFT CLICK IS ALREADY USED BECAUSE IT HIGHLIGHTS THAT UM
UM EITHER WE COULD DO THAT YOU KNOW WHEN DOES THE POP UP COME
EITHER WE CAN WHEN YOU CLICK ON THE THE I. D. ANY SORT OF I. D. IN THE TRANSCRIPTION BOX
OR WE CAN PUT AN EXTRA BUTTON EXTRA FEW BUTTONS NEXT TO THE SUMMARISE BUTTON SO THAT YOU ACTUALLY IN THE TRANSCRIPTION BOX
BUT SO LIKE YOU CLICK ON A BUTTON AND THEN THAT OPENS WHATEVER THAT SPEAKER CHARACTERISATION IS
D YEAH
HMM
YOU CAN FOR EXAMPLE SET SET THE MARKER THERE SO THAT THE MM THE AUDIO GOES FROM THERE I THINK
SO THAT YOU CAN I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DOUBLE CLICK ACTUALLY
BUT THAT'D BE A BIT ANNOYING IF YOU HAVE LEFT CLICK FOR ONE THING AND DOUBLE CLICK FOR SOMETHING ELSE
THAT PART OF SPEECH OR WHATEVER THAT WHAT HE'S BEEN SAYING YOU KNOW THE THE LEFT CLICK HIGHLIGHTS IT
UM I THINK SO YEAH WHEN YOU LEFT CLICK IT
THE L THE LEFT CLICK OR THE RIGHT CLICK
YEAH
RIGHT
CAN YOU USE DOUBLE CLICK OR
YEAH I DON'T KNOW
WE COULD PUT IT ON A RIGHT CLICK
UM SO WE CAN'T PUT IT ON LEFT CLICK
WE COULD FOR EXAMPLE HAVE A LITTLE MENU THAT POPS UP
YEAH IT MIGHT BE QUITE GOOD I SUPPOSE
YEAH
SO RIGHT CLICK ON AT MENU YOU KNOW AND YOU CAN CLICK ON SPEAKER CHARACTERISATION UP POPS THE WINDOW
WHAT ELSE COULD WE HAVE IN THE MENU
I DON'T KNOW
NOTHING ELSE
THAT'S A GOOD POINT
OKAY
SO OTHERWISE YOU JUST HAVE A RIGHT CLICK OR DO YOU HAVE HAVE A
EVERYTHING
HMM
YEAH
HMM
YEAH
IT OPENS A MENU
SO BUT THAT'D BE YEAH
YEAH YEAH BUT UM I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT UH USUALLY IN WINDOWS RIGHT CLICK DOESN'T DO ANYTHING DOES IT
IF YOU JUST YEAH
YEAH SO YEAH
IS A WINDOW
YEAH IT'S WHY
AND SO IT MIGHT BE A BIT WEIRD THE FIR TO JUST START BRINGING UP STUFF AND THEN IT
A MENU YEAH YEAH
AND THEN
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
SO
TO JUST HAVE THE SORT OF MAIN SAME SORT OF IDIOM THROUGHOUT KINDA
YEAH
YEAH
HMM
UM OR JUST YOU KNOW OR JUST THE BUTTON
YEAH
I GUESS A BUTTON BUTTON MAKES A BIT MORE SENSE 'CAUSE OTHERWISE YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW THAT OH WHAT IF I RIGHT CLICK NOW WHAT HAPPENS THEN
YEAH
IT'S LIKE MORE IF IT'S VISUAL
WELL NO NO YOU STILL HAVE THE MENU THE MENU POP UP THAT
HMM
YEAH
YEAH
IT'S MORE
IT'S MORE OBVIOUS ISN'T IT W WHAT YOU CAN DO
WELL OH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
THAT'S TRUE YEAH IT'S MORE INTUITIVE REALLY ISN'T IT
DO YOU SEE MY
IT'S GOT A BUTTON
IT'S MORE IDIOT PROOF ISN'T IT
BUT THEN IT'S NOT AS EXTENSIBLE
YEAH
LIKE IF WE WANNA ADD MORE THINGS IN THE FUTURE THEN WE HAVE TO WELL NEW BUTTONS
YEAH
BUT WE'RE PROBABLY NOT GONNA BE ADDING TOO MANY THINGS
WHEREAS A MENU TYPE THING IS MORE FLEXIBLE THAT WAY
I DON'T KNOW
YEAH
BUT WELL WE WE CAN HAVE BOTH BUT WHATEVER
MAYBE MAYBE
ADD MORE BUTTONS
YOU CAN HAVE A MENU INSTEAD OF A BUTTON BUT THIS WHY I DON'T THINK IT YEAH
YEAH
WELL IN UH I GUESS IN IN IN MEETING BROWSER ONE POINT ONE
OKAY EXACTLY
I KNOW I KNOW
TRUE TRUE
YES
IN THE BETA VERSION
UM BUT ACTUALLY WHAT WE COULD DO IS ON IN THAT MENU AS WELL WE COULD HAVE AN OPTION THAT POPS UP A WINDOW WITH ALL THE ALL THE MEETINGS THAT THAT USER HAS BEEN IN
HMM
LIKE A SEARCH FOR THAT USER
IS THAT GONNA BE USEFUL OR TOO MUCH
OR
YEP
I GUESS SO
SO WHAT DID YOU PART OF THE M THE MENU THAT COMES DOWN IT SAYS GIVE ME ALL YOUR MEETINGS OR SOMETHING
YEAH SO Y WHEN YOU RIGHT CLICK ON IT ONE ONE OPTION WILL BE GIVE ME ALL YOUR MEETINGS CHARACTERISE THE SPEAKER
YEP
OR IS THAT TOO MUCH I MEAN
YEAH UM I DON'T I MEAN IT W IT'S MORE LIKE PART OF THE
IT'S AN IDEA
I GUESS SO
GET TO USE MY PEN
MORE THAN THE SPEAKER CHARACTERISATION AS M STEVE MENTIONED
BROWSING SORT OF THINGY
UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW TO INVOLVE THE SPEAKER CHARACTERISATION INTO THE BROWSING
YEAH THAT'S TRUE YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
HMM
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
IT'D NICE TO HAVE IT INCONNEC INTERCONNECTED LIKE
ACTUALLY
YEAH BUT MAYBE TIE THAT IN WITH DIALOGUE ACTS OR SOMETHING AS WELL
I MEAN SPEAKER CHARACTERISATION TIED INTO I DON'T KNOW
DI JUST SOME WAY TO SORT OF LEVERAGE THAT INFORMATION
LIKE WE HAVE IT WE'RE DOING IT BUT WHAT HOW DOES IT HELP THE BROWSING
OR WHAT CAN IT GIVE US IN THE BROWSING
YEAH
YEAH
OH WELL YEAH I MEAN
OR YOU MEAN THE THE SPEAKER CHARACTERISATION
I MEAN IT'S THE SPEAKER CHARACTERISATION IS A BIT LIKE YOU SAID
I MEAN IT'S LIKE A NICE THING
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT
WE DON'T WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY SURE WHAT THE USER WANTS WITH IT BUT IT'S INTERESTING SO WHY NOT GIVE IT TO HIM
HMM
YEAH YEAH
RIGHT
YEAH WELL
I MEAN
I I THINK WE SHOULD DO IT
YEAH
AND IN THAT WAY BUT I DON'T KNOW
AND THEN IF YOU I DON'T KNOW CLICK ON THAT TOPIC YOU GET EVERYTHING THAT'S IN THAT TOPIC OR WHATEVER
WELL IF YOU GET THE SPEAKER CHARACTERISATION THAT SOMEONE S TALKS A LOT IN UH A CERTAIN TOPIC
I MEAN I GUESS MAYBE WE COULD HAVE THAT AS ANOTHER THING OF LIKE
Y WE HAVE TO FIRST DEFINE WHAT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU CLICK ON A USER
I MEAN WE'RE NOT EVEN THERE YET
YEAH I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S STILL ANOTHER LEVEL FURTHER
YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T EVEN DOESN'T EVEN POP UP THE SPEAKER CHARACTERISATION YET
YEAH
NO NO NO
OH YEAH
SO YEAH THERE YOU GO
WE HAVE TO HAVE A SPEAKER CHARACTERISATION FIRST BEFORE WE CROSS ANY OF THE OTHER BRIDGES
SO SHOULD WE TRY TRY TO DO A RIGHT CLICK WHEN YOU THEN
YES
YEAH
YEAH
TRUE YEAH
YEAH
WHY NOT
ALRIGHT
YEAH
IS THAT IS THAT FROM ANY PARTICULAR WINDOW LIKE IF WE WANNA SORTA GET LIKE IF WE WERE ON THE USERS VERSUS LIKE TOPIC OR SOMETHING
HAVE A RIGHT CLICK FROM FOR THESE VARIOUS THINGS TO YEAH
IS THAT JUST FROM THE MAIN MAIN WINDOW
SORRY
EVEN IF ONLY ONE THING COMES UP
AND TO HAVE A DIFFERENT MENU FOR OUR
YEAH
WE WANNA SOMEHOW CLICK BE ABLE TO CLICK ON A TOPIC AND IT POPS UP WITH ALL THE MEETINGS THAT CONTAIN THAT
YEAH THERE'S A SECOND THING ABOUT THE TOPICS THE TOPIC WINDOW
SO WE COULD DO THAT IN A SIMILAR WAY DO IT RIGHT CLICK AS WELL
YEAH
YES
WAIT
RIGHT YEAH
YEP
YEAH
SO AND SO THIS LOT IS FOR UM
OKAY
OKAY YEAH
SO YEAH
NOW IT'S CONSISTENT THROUGHOUT
YEAH
ON THE T SPEAKER
SO YEAH
SO WE HAVE BASICALLY TWO OPTIONS OF OF BROWSING THE MEETINGS IS BY EITHER UM SEARCHING AND OPENING INDIVIDUAL OBSERVATIONS
AND WHEN THEN WE HAVE THE INTERLINKING BY RIGHT CLICK BASICALLY
AND THEN THIS LOT IS ON TH
RIGHT
SO IF SOMEBODY KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANNA DO AND WE KNOW THAT THAT'S THE MOST COMMON THING THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN
SO THE DOUBLE CLICK WILL DO THAT AND SO SAVE THEM THE TROUBLE OF RIGHT CLICKING AND CHOOSING THE ITEM ON THE MENU
LIKE IF WE HAVE IT SO IT'S SET UP THAT UM IF YOU DOUBLE CLICK AND IT GOES TO A DEFAULT THING ON THE MENU
AND JUST SHOW UP THE THE PARTICULAR INSTANCES OF THAT TOPIC IN A MEETING
I MEAN THAT'S KIND OF A TYPICAL KINDA ACTION THAT WOULD HAPPEN
EITHER WHATEVER WE DECIDE THE DEFAULT TO BE WHETHER IT'S IN ALL MEETINGS OR JUST IN ONE MEETING
SO IT'LL BE LIKE ALL THE UM CASES OF THAT TOPIC
IF YOU DOUBLE CLICK ON A PARTICULAR TOPIC OR SOMETHING THEN IT GOES TO SORT OF A LIKE A DEFAULT VIEW
ACTUALLY YEAH LIKE UM ANOTHER COMMON THING
LIKE I'M JUST THINKING TO HAVE THE DEFAULT THERE
DOUBLE CLICK
OH
HMM
YEAH
I DON'T SEE THERE'S ANYTHING OBVIOUS THAT WAS THAT WOULD BE ABLE YOU KNOW THAT WOULD BE
YEAH
WELL IT MIGHT COME TO US AS WE START PLAYING WITH IT
YEAH
I DIDN'T QUITE UNDERSTAND
WHAT WAS THAT
DO YOU MEAN
YEAH
YOU'LL HAVE THE MENU RIGHT CLICK IT BUT INSTEAD OF LIKE HAVE A DEFAULT DOUBLE CLICK
SO IF THERE'S A DE SO IT'LL BE A CHOICE FROM THE MENU BUT YEAH EXACTLY
UM LIKE WE HAVE THE THE RIGHT CLICK MENU
UH JUST LET TH
YEAH
OH
OH SO AND IT FIGURES OUT WHAT'S THE MOST COMMON USE TO DOUBLE CLICK
OKAY
YEP
YEAH
OR JUST I DON'T KNOW
LIKE I DON'T KNOW SHOW THE SPEAKER CHARACTERISATION FOR INSTANCE
YEAH
YEAH BUT THEN THEN THERE'S THE PROBLEM WITH A LOT OF WINDOWS POPPING UP AGAIN
AND THEY POP UP WITHOUT YOU EVEN BEING QUITE SURE WHAT IT IS YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
YEAH
HMM
YEAH
YEAH
BUT IF YOU DO DOUBLE CLICK ON SOMETHING DON'T YOU EXPECT SOMETHING TO HAPPEN THEN
HMM
YEAH MAYBE
MM
HMM
SORT OF WELL I DON'T KNOW
YEAH
STOP COMING UP
YOU OH GO AWAY
SOMETIMES YOU DO IT BY ACCIDENT THOUGH
NO
T THROW STUFF THROWING OUT THE WINDOW
YEAH YEAH OH YEAH
YEAH
IT JUST GOES OH
BUT BUT YEAH MM BUT I DON'T I DON'T I D REALLY DON'T SEE ANYTHING OBVIOUS THAT THAT WOULD
WELL I'LL I'LL CHECK WHAT IT DOES ON ON UM DOUBLE CLICK AT THE MOMENT
ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE A TOUCH PAD
'CAUSE I THINK IT MIGHT DO SOMETHING
YOU KNOW IT'S NOT IT'S NOT THE END OF THE WORLD
WELL THEN THEY CLOSE IT
YEAH EXACTLY
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH UH THAT WAS GOOD START
OKAY
YEP
I MEAN IF YOU CAN THINK OF SOMETHING THAT
I DON'T KNOW
SORRY
I GUESS IT DEPENDS ON THE
OBVIOUSLY
YEAH WHAT YOU'RE CLICKING ON
DO WE WANNA USE THEM OR NOT
UM YEAH ANOTHER THING
SORRY
SINGLE AUDIO FILES
HMM
WE DON'T KNOW YET DO WE I DON'T THINK
DO YOU MEAN THE SINGLE CHANNEL
DO WE WANT THEM
YEAH SINGLE CHANNEL THAT'S SINGLE CHANNEL FILES
I MEAN
SINGLE CHANNEL
MM
BUT AT THE MOMENT NO
BUT YEAH
PROBABLY NOT BUT WE MIGHT NEED THEM FOR DISFLUENCIES IF WE TRY DO IT IN AUDIO
NO
WELL YEAH
YEAH OKAY YEAH YEAH
I MEAN WE MIGHT USE THEM WHILE WO TO WORK WITH THEM BUT DO WE WANNA INTEGRATE THEM IN SO THAT WHEN YOU BROWSE YOU CAN HERE'S
WE MIGHT WANT TO BE ABLE TO SAY OH JUST GIVE ME WHAT THAT PERSON'S SAYING
DOES IT
I MEAN IT'S NOT GONNA MAKE MUCH SENSE IF YOU DON'T LISTEN TO IT ON ITS OWN D DO YOU
DO YOU THOUGH
NO
WELL P
UNLESS UM YOU CAN'T HEAR IT PROPERLY OR SOMETHING
SOMEBODY'S TALKING OVER SOMEBODY ELSE OR SOMETHING
YEAH YEAH
W WE JUST SAY NO FOR NOW AND PUT IT IN LATER OR SOMETHING
NO HMM
YEAH
YEAH
THEREFORE PRINT WILL BE BIGGER
YEAH 'CAUSE OTHERWISE IT WILL THE IT WILL INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF DATA WE NEED BY A LOT WON'T IT
YEAH
MM-HMM
UM
DO YOU THINK DO YOU THINK IT'S REALLY THAT BAD
YEAH WH WHAT DO PEOPLE THINK IN GENERAL ABOUT THE WINDOWS CLUTTERING THAT HE'S MENTIONED
I THINK WE PROBABLY NEED THAT THOUGH TO HAVE THE F THE FULL FLEXIBILITY WE NEED TO HAVE THAT THERE BUT UM YEAH
I MEAN I'M I'M VERY MUCH I W I WANNA HAVE EVERYTHING CUSTOMISABLE
UM
THAT'S WHAT I FEEL AS WELL
MM-HMM
ALTHOUGH THE THING IS TYPICALLY THOUGH IS SOMEONE GONNA HAVE FIVE WINDOWS OPEN AT THE SAME TIME PROBABLY NOT
PROBABLY JUST TWO OR TWO OR THREE OF WHATEVER WHATEVER THEY'RE LOOKING AT LIKE DIALOGUE ACTS TO WHATEVER CHARACTERISATIONS
BUT IT'D BE GOOD TO HAVE IT THERE
AND THE SUMMARY FOR EXAMPLE IS TYPICAL
PROBABLY NOT NO
BUT YEAH IT DEPENDS I MEAN I I REALLY WANNA PUT THE SUMMARY IN SOMEWHERE YOU KNOW
YEAH
TWO OR THREE MAYBE BUT YEAH
YOU OPEN THE WINDOW YOU READ THROUGH IT YOU MIGHT CLICK ON YOU KNOW CLOSE IT AGAIN STRAIGHT AWAY
HMM
YEAH
NO I THINK IT'S I THINK IT'S FINE
I THINK WHAT WE'RE DOING IS FINE
YEAH
YEAH TRUE
YEAH
BUT UH WELL COULDN'T WE I MEAN YOU PROBABLY I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANNA HAVE LIKE THE THE FULL TRANSCRIPTION AND THE SUMMARY AT THE SAME TIME
SO MAYBE YOU CAN JUST LIKE CHOOSE THE S SAME WINDOW FOR TRANSCRIPTION AND SUMMARY
HMM
SO LIKE HAVE A TAB THERE
FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT CHOOSE ON CHOOSE ONE
I WAS JUST THINKING OF TAB
I LIKE TABS
TABS ARE NICE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH TABS ARE GOOD
YEAH
MOZILLA STYLE
YEAH
YEA YEAH YEAH YEAH
THAT TRUE
I'M NOT SURE YEAH
THAT'S RIGHT
BUT I DUNNO BUT
I DON'T KNOW HOW EASY IT IS
BUT BUT
I DON'T THINK JAVA KNOWS HOW TO DO THAT REALLY
OR CAN YOU DO THAT IN JAVA
DOES ANYBODY KNOW HOW TO DO THAT
MAYBE YEAH YOU PROBABLY CAN
I'M SURE YOU COULD DO ANYTHING
NO
I'M SURE
I DON'T KNOW
DO YOU RECKON
YEAH
OH YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
BUT I DON'T KNOW
IT'S A BIT OF A CRIPPLE WITH JAVA'S WINDOWING TOOL KIT
IF YOU REALLY KNEW WHAT YOU'RE DOING
THE EIGHT IS SOMETIMES IT'S A BIT OF A CRIPPLE
YEAH
HMM
YEAH
I CAN HAVE A LOOK
YEAH
YEAH UH CHANGE THE CONTENTS OF THE SAME WINDOW LIKE FROM TRANSCRIPTION TO SUMMARY
YEAH
OR JUST I DON'T KNOW
BUT YEAH THAT THAT MIGHT BE AN IDEA YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
PROBABLY YEAH
HMM
YEAH OR EVEN JUST HAVE BUTTONS ON IT TOGGLE BUTTONS OR SOMETHING ON THE TOOL BAR FOR THAT WINDOW
HMM
JUST SOMETHING
THAT COULD PROBABLY
YEAH YEAH
A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS WE CAN DO IT IT DOESN'T DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A TAB OR WHATEVER
JUST GONNA BE YEAH
YEAH
NO NO IT COULD BE LIKE TRANSCRIPTION SUMMARY LIKE TWO BUTTONS AND YOU JUST PRESS ON WHICH EVER YOU WANT
EXACTLY
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
EVEN HAVE TWO OF 'EM CHECKED AND SEND YEAH
OR CHECK MARKS
WHICH IS QUITE GOOD
THERE'S ALWAYS STUFF IN THE WAY ISN'T THERE
'CAUSE OTHERWISE PHOTOSHOP HAS A LOT OF WINDOWS IF YOU EVER USE PHOTOSHOP IT'S GOT LOADS
SO
AND YOU'RE ALWAYS G FOREVER GOING NO GET OUT OF THE WAY
YEAH THAT WILL REDUCE THE NUMBER OF UM WINDOWS WE NEEDED WOULDN'T IT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH EXACTLY
I DON'T LIKE POP UPS
YEAH
BUT I MEAN PEOPLE GET USED TO IT I MEAN WHEN YOU USE A WINDOWS OR LINUX FOR THAT MATTER YOU HAVE A LOT OF WINDOWS OPEN

BY THE BASICS IS UH OH OKAY THAT'S GOOD
BUT YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S HANDY
UM
YEAH
UM YEAH I GUESS THAT'S IT
SO YOU THINK IT SHOULDN'T BE TOO DIFFICULT
UH I'M I WAS A BIT WORRIED ABOUT WHEN WELL WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT THIS WITH THE MM FILE MESSING AROUND WITH FILES
LIKE EXTRACTING THINGS FROM THE X. M. L. FILES AND STUFF TO BE ABLE TO DO THE INDEXING
I MEAN UH HOW MUCH DO WE ACTUALLY NEED TO DO
I DON'T KNOW
HMM
YOU HAVE TO CONVERT IT TO SOME SORT OF FORMAT I SUPPOSE
OH I SEE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
SO IT WILL COME UP ON THE SCREEN FOR THE MOMENT I HAVEN'T MANAGED TO PUT IT INTO A VECTOR OR WHATEVER IN JAVA TO PLAY WITH IT
YEAH IN JAVA YEAH
AND I CAN GET RID OF IT BUT I'M HAVING TROUBLE PUTTING IT ANYWHERE ELSE
BUT I GUESS IT'S NOT VERY DIFFICULT
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO G WRITE SOMETHING TO READ THE X. M. L. AND GET RID OF IT
OKAY
HUH

OKAY
OKAY
WHAT ARE YOU WRITING IN JAVA OR YEAH OKAY
YEAH
OKAY
RIGHT
YEAH
YOU KNOW A BUNCH ABOUT FILE THINGS
PUT IT INTO A WINDOW AT LEAST
I MEAN YOU SHOULD LOOK AT LOOK HAVE A LOOK AT THE THE BROWSER CODE THEN BECAUSE UM YOU KNOW THEY ALREADY EXTRACT FOR EXAMPLE TRANSCRIPTS
YEAH YEAH I'M SURE THEY DO
YEAH
YEAH IT'S GOOD IDEA
OH YEAH I WILL
I'M SURE I'M MAKING A MEAL OF IT AT THE MOMENT ACTUALLY
I'M SURE IT'S NOTHING DIFFICULT

YEP
HMM
YEAH
YEAH OH YEAH
YEAH
JUST SO STUPID
OH THAT'S COMPLETE RUBBISH ANYWAY
NEVER MIND
MORE DIFFI IT WAS IT WASN'T MARKED BUT IT WAS I HAD TO SIT THERE AND THINK ABOUT IT FOR A BIT WHICH IS A BIT IRRITATING
YEAH

YEAH WE'RE GONNA MEET UP
YEP
MM-HMM
YEAH
WHICH I THINK IS ODD BUT I'M NOT QUITE SURE HOW IT WORKS YET
I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND IT
WELL YE THE BROWSER AS I USE IT NOW OR AS UH YOU KNOW
IT WAS THERE WHEN I TOOK IT UM USES THE UM THE N. X. T. SEARCH TO GET THE DATA OUT OF THE OUT THE FILES
'CAUSE IT'S NOW
WHY
OKAY
SO WHEN IT WHEN IT
YEAH
TO GET THE DATA I FOR EXAMPLE TO GET THE SUMMARISATION DATA YOU HAVE TO SEARCH FOR I THINK THE I. D. S OR SOMETHING
THAT'S PRETTY BIZARRE ISN'T IT
WELL I GUESS THAT'S HOW IT WORKS
THEY'VE GOT D
YEAH
THAT IS PRETTY BIZARRE
SO THEY DON'T YOU KNOW THEY DON'T SAY LOOK IN THAT AND THAT FOLDER BUT THEY SAY SEARCH EVERYTHING
YEAH YEAH
THAT IS PRETTY BIZARRE
YEAH
WELL THEY DID SAY IT WASN'T THE MOST EFFICIENT
VERY CLEARLY YEAH
HMM
OKAY
OH IT DOES LOAD UP QUITE QUICKLY
SO YOU KNOW IT'S NOT TOO BAD
BUT YOU KNOW YOU COULD HAVE A LOOK AT THEM
OKAY
D OKAY
OR IS IT JUST WHAT'S BEHIND IT
BUT IT WHAT WHAT IS IT LIKE A WINDOW WHERE YOU HAVE TO WR WRITE THE SEARCH QUERY
SO OR HOW DOES IT WORK THEN
NO THIS IS NOT THE ACTUAL SEARCH
THIS IS JUST WHEN YOU OPEN WHAT YOU KNOW TO LOAD THE TRANSCRIPT FOR EXAMPLE TO FIND THE TRANSCRIPT FOR A CERTAIN MEETING
IT DOES DOES AN N. X. T. SEARCH FOR THE STRING I DON'T KNOW TRANSCRIPT OR TEXT OR WHATEVER
YEAH
YEAH
WH
OKAY
FOUR AND IT W IT LI IT JUST HAS AN OPEN VARIABLE TRANSPARENT S LIST WHATEVER FIND EVERYTHING THAT'S GOT THAT AND THEN LOAD
YEAH
YEAH SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE LOOKED AT THE SEARCH QUERY S LANGUAGE BUT IT'S LIKE A DOLLAR A. TEXT SAY
YEAH YEAH 'CAUSE THAT'S THE UH THE DECLARES A VARIABLE DOESN'T IT AND THEN THEY KEEP OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
AND THEN YEAH
YEAH
BECAUSE EVERY EVERY OF ALL OF THESE UM
AND ALL THE TRANSCRIPT FILES HAVE GOT THE STRING I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS
THESE FILES HAVE GOT UM THA AN I. D.
WORDS OR TEXT OR SOMETHING IN IT SO IT JUST SEARCHES FOR THOSE FILES
OKAY
RIGHT
VAGUELY
WHEN YOU LIKE YOU IS THERE A OPEN THINGY OR LIKE WELL WHAT DID YOU TWO DO TO LIKE HOW DID YOU FIGURE OUT THAT THIS USES N. X. T. SEARCH LIKE IS IT
SO
OPEN
UM UM WELL IT'S IN THE CODE
I HAD TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO HOW TO DO THE SAME THING FOR THE SUMMARY
JUST THAT IT YOU KNOW IT YEAH YOU DEFINE A SEARCH OBJECT AND THEN YOU SEARCH ON THAT STRING
THAT'S HOW I
OKAY
OKAY
OH SEE OBVIOUS
I HAD TO I HAD TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO DO THE TRANSCRIPT HOW THEY DID THE TRANSCRIPT TO DO THE SUMMARY MYSELF
SO DID YOU HAVE TO WRITE IT IN THE WAY THAT THEY WROTE IT IS THAT WHAT YOU DID
YEAH JUST SEARCH FOR A SPECIFIC STRING
RIGHT
OKEYDOKE
YEAH
SO YOU COULD JUST YOU KNOW YOU COULD USE THAT WHEN YOU IF YOU WANNA UM TAKE THE DATA OUT AND PUT IT SOMEWHERE
FISH THE DATA I WAS JUST THINKING THAT YEAH
YEAH
YOU KNOW WHATEVER YOU WANNA DO THEN JUST SEND ME AN EMAIL
IF YOU HAVE A A QUESTION ABOUT W WHAT THE P THE CODE MEANS OR WHERE TO FIND THE CODE THAT YOU WANNA
MM-HMM
MM
I CAN EXPLAIN IT
YEAH
NOT YET
HAVE YOU ANNOTATED YOUR CODE NICELY
OKAY
ACTUALLY IN THE MOMENT IT'S GOT A LOAD OF RUBBISH BECAUSE THE THE UM THE BROWSER THAT I USED FROM THIS FROM YOU KNOW

WELL THAT'S THAT'S THE ORIG THIS THE ORIGINAL ONE
YEAH
OH THIS IS THE ONE THAT OKAY
OH THERE'S MORE
OH I SEE
I THINK IT UM ONE THING THAT WE COULD PROBABLY SKIP UH TOTALLY IS THE REMOVING THINGS FROM THE AUDIO FILES
PROBABLY WANNA THINK ABOUT IF WE WANNA CHANGE OUR GOALS AND STUFF
MM-HMM
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT AS WELL I MEAN DO WE ARE WE ARE WE ACTUALLY GONNA ATTEMPT THAT
YEAH
YEAH
THAT'S NO I DON'T TH THAT'S THAT'S TOO BIG YEAH
NAH
I THINK THAT'S GONNA BE A B WE DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO APPROACH THAT AT THE MOMENT I THINK
I DON'T THINK SO EITHER YEAH
YEAH
NO
YEAH
A GOOD FUTURE WORK THING ISN'T IT
IT'S A GOOD THING TO HAVE TO SAY WE COU WHAT WE COULD HAVE DONE IF WE HAD MORE TIME
SHOULD IF WE HAD MORE TIME THIS IS WHAT WE WOULD HAVE DONE
YEAH
STICK IN THE CONCLUSION OF THE FINAL REPORT
YEAH
YEAH
UNLESS WE D UNLESS WE DISCOVER SOME SORTA TIME WARP THING IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
BUT PUT IT UNDER CHANGES SINCE THE INITIAL SPECIFICATION
UM UM SO MAYBE I MEAN WE WE SHOULD WE SHOULD DEFINITELY WELL WE COULD PROBABLY NOT PUT IT UNDER THIS HEADING
AND SAY YOU KNOW WE DIDN'T WE DECIDED THE THE R TIME IS TOO SHORT WHATEVER
YEAH YEAH
YEAH IF YEAH IF
YEAH BUT THAT'S DEFINITELY ONE THING WE COULD JUST REMOVE
YEAH SURE
YEAH
YEP
YEAH
WE DON'T THINK THERE'S ENOUGH TIME
OR WE FELT THERE WERE MORE IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO WITH OUR TIME THAN
YES
MM-HMM
THAN WORRY ABOUT
YEAH
WE WOULD PREFER TO CONCENTRATE ON THE MAIN
YEAH
AND I THINK WE SHOULD PROBABLY UH COMMENT EXPLICITLY ON THE MILESTONES HERE AS WELL AND SAY WE MANAGED TO DO
YEAH
YEAH
OR SOME OF THEM WERE LATER SOME WERE YEAH
WE COULD EVEN
THIS THIS AND THIS
M M MEET THESE MILESTONES AT YEAH
YEAH THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
YOU HAVE SHOULD HAVE A SECTION PROBABLY
I MEAN WE HAVEN'T REALLY YEAH
UH
LIKE YOU KNOW DEVELOP PROTOTYPE GUI
WE T YOU KNOW AH YEAH WE MANAGED THAT NICELY
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
EXACTLY
THE BEST FILE ON TARGET OR SOMETHING
MORE OR LESS
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S THAT THAT'S TRUE TOO
THAT'S TRUE YEAH
SEARCH YEAH
P PLUS PLUS OR MINUS THREE DAYS TO YEAH
YEAH PUT IT PUT IT GOOD
YEAH YEAH
HE HE D HE DOESN'T HAVE TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I MEAN YEAH M I MEAN IT'S HOT FINISHED BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY SAY
OR T WELL
CONCEPTUALLY
AND SO I'VE ONLY GOT SIX DAYS TO DO THE TOPIC SEGMENTATION AS WELL
JESUS
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY UH S. P. N. L. P. ASSIGNMENTS DO YOU
AH THAT'S PLENTY
UH
YEAH
WE UH SAY WE ARE STILL AIMING FOR THE DEVELOPMENT TO BE COMPLETE ON THE OR SOMETHING
M
AND YOU CAN SAY YEAH
SPEAKER CHARACTERISATION
JESUS
SPEAKER CHARACTERISATION'S SUPPOSED TO BE DONE ALREADY
YEAH TWO DAYS AGO
YEAH
OH REALLY
OH JEEZ
H UM IS ARE ONE OF THOSE SOMETHING THAT YOU WANNA CHANGE AND DELETE FROM OUR LIST OF EXPECTATIONS
WHOA
GIVE ME A WEEK AND I'LL TELL YOU THE ANSWER TO THAT
OKAY
LIKE SHOULD WE PUT I A HINT THAT SOMETHING LIKE THAT MIGHT HAPPEN INTO THE DOCUMENT
YEAH
ALRIGHT
I YEAH I
OR MAYBE THE SPEAKER CHARACTERISATION MIGHT GET SLIMMER
I MEAN IT'S NOT IT'S NOT GONNA BE DIFFICULT
SO IT'S DEFINITELY GONNA BE SOMETHING THERE
THAT'S GONNA BE NO WORK AT ALL
IF AT LEAST HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION POP UP THAT IS ALREADY IN THE META DATA FILE
I I REALLY WANNA DO IT
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH I KNOW
ALRIGHT
OKAY
OKAY
PROBABLY WE WON'T DISAPPEAR IT YEAH
YEAH
YEAH OKAY
YEAH TRUE
MM-HMM

OKAY SOUNDS GOOD
YEAH
YEAH
UM BUT WE MIGHT NOT YOU KNOW BUT WE MIGHT HAVE TIME
DEPENDS HOW HOW HOW HOW THINGS M
YEAH IT MIGHT TURN OUT EASIER THAN THOUGHT
UM
LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS
IT JUST NEEDS TO BE DONE BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN THE CO YEAH TUNED YEAH
A SEARCH THROUGH THE PARAMETERS OR SOMETHING
THE TOPIC SEGMENTATION WITH THE L. C. SEG AND TEXT TILES BASICALLY DONE
YEAH
TUNED I GUESS OR YEAH
OKAY
COOL
MM
YEAH SOUNDS GOOD
WHAT ELSE
OKAY
HMM
I DON'T KNOW
SHALL WE CHANGE THE DEADLINES
THAT'S WHAT HE HINTED THAT WE SHOULD ALSO UM INDICATE WHO WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT FROM NOW ON
WE SHOULD PROBABLY D SORRY WE SHOULD PROBABLY DO ANOTHER RESPONSIBILITY OF PACKAGES AS WELL
RIGHT
THAT'S ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS IT WAS
WELL I COULD PROBABLY JUST COPY THAT STRAIGHT OUT OF THE OTHER ONE AS WELL
MAYBE MORE DETAILED SPECIFICALLY
YEAH
YEAH PRETTY MUCH
WELL YOU COULD PUT YOU KNOW YEAH I DON'T KNOW
MM
YEAH
SHOULD WE I MEAN NOW YEAH
I MEAN WE HAVE IT NOW LIKE INVERTED AND YOU HAVE THE OTHER BUT WHAT ABOUT THE M
SHOULD WE I DON'T KNOW DO YOU THINK MIKE ABOUT OUR THINGS THAT WE HAD TOGETHER
SPLIT THOSE APART
I THINK SO YEAH LIKE YEAH INVERTED FILE
YEAH EXACTLY
YEAH
REMOVING DISFLUENCIES
SHALL WE JUST
OH
WELL IF WE'RE SKIPPING THE AUDIO ONE AND THEN THINGS GOT EASIER
UM
YEAH WE JUST KEEP IT TOGETHER ON THE THE PAP THERE RIGHT NOW AND JUST SEE WHAT WHAT
YEAH
HAVE YOU TAKEN ANY MORE OF A LOOK AT IT
AT THE DISFLUENC OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
HAVE YOU TAKEN ANY MORE OF A LOOK AT IT
WE COULD PROBABLY
NO HAVEN'T
NO NOT THE DISFLUENCIES
WE COULD JUST MAKE IT UP
I KNOW IF WE'LL HAVE TIME TO LOOK AT THAT BEFORE TOMORROW
LIKE I'LL CLAIM ONE YOU'LL CLAIM THE OTHER FOR THE SEARCH THINGS AND THEN WE COULD LEAVE THAT ONE AS A A JOINT ONE
YEAH MIGHT BE YEAH
YEAH
SO UM
YEAH
'KAY
AND THAT'D BE GOOD
SOMETHING
HAVE YOU MANAGED ANY FURTHER ON THE SEARCH THING
UM I FOUND FINALLY TODAY SOMETHING THAT I CAN BUILD IT IN AND IT UH I SHOULD HAVE SOMETHING FOR TOMORROW
HAVE AN IMAGE IN MY MIND AND I JUST WANNA SEE IT ON THE THING AND THEN GET A NICE SCREEN SHOT
SO I WANNA GET SOMETHING I WANNA SEE THIS I WANNA GET IT TOGETHER
I SHOULD UH YOU KNOW AT LEAST VERY LEAST HAVE UH UM A GUI AND UH WIRE I'LL BE WIRING THAT IN HOPEFULLY TOMORROW MORNING
SO
ALRIGHT
THAT'S NICE
YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH
UM
SO ALSO I DON'T KNOW IF WE SEND IT IN ON THE AFTERNOON MAYBE I CAN ADD A FEW SENTENCES TOO WHEN I'M DONE
YEAH MY INTENT IS TO WORK ON THESE THINGS TOMORROW A BIT MORE
MM-HMM
WELL
I MEAN AND ALSO SOME SOMETIMES IT'S A BIT OF A MOTIVATING FACTOR TOO
I MEAN YOU WRITE DOWN THE WORDS AND THE IDEAS AS OH OKAY
WELL I'LL DO THIS I'LL DO THAT YOU KNOW IT JUST ALL FALLS TOGETHER
I MEAN WITH THE INTENTION THAT THIS IS DONE
W WELL WELL IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER I MEAN YOU COULD WRITE THE SENTENCES FIRST AS WELL
YEAH YEAH YEAH
CERTAINLY
THEN IT'S DONE
OH YEP
AND IF IT'S NOT HOPEFULLY IT WON'T BE
YEAH
WE'LL SEE
YEAH
FOR THE D INVERTED FILE
HOW ABOUT THE UNDERLYING DATA FOR IT
HOW'S THAT COMING ALONG
HMM
OH
BUT YEAH BUT I'LL WORK ON IT
UM I THINK UH I WAS WONDERING ABOUT THAT IS UH I HAVEN'T LOOKED AT IT SO MUCH
WELL I WAS STILL LIKE STRUGGLING WITH JAVA STUFF
BUT IF M ANY OF YOU GUYS KNOW HOW WE COULD DO THE LIKE FROM THE UH EXTRACT WORDS THAT YOU DID
LIKE ALSO IN UH IN THIS EXTRACT T TIME STAMPS ON STUFF SO WE CAN IS IT
OH YEAH
YEAH
COMING ALONG
JUST YEAH WELL IT JUST UM WHEN HE PULLS UP THE SEGMENTS UM PART OF THAT ONE OF THE F ONE OF THE ATTRIBUTES YOU DO GET ATTRIBUTES
GET ATTRIBUTES IT RETURNS A LIST OF ATTRIBUTES
AND THEN YOU CAN EITHER DO IT AUTOMATICALLY OR YOU CAN JUST HARD CODE AND SAY LOOK GET ME THE TIME STAMPS
SO YOU JUST SAY UM GET ATTRIBUTE AND PUT I THINK IT'S I THINK THE METHOD'S CALLED GET ATTRIBUTE AND JUST IT'S CALLED START TIME AND END TIME
AND THAT WILL TELL YOU THE START TIMES AND END TIMES
SEARCH THROUGH THOSE AND AND THEN IT JUST YOU CAN THAT WILL TELL YOU WHAT ATTRIBUTES IT'S GOT
EASY YEAH
I THINK IT RETURNS IT DOUBLE
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
SO NOW I COULD JUST PUT IT IN SOME
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S ON THE UM THE N THE THE NOM RIGHT ELEMENTS
THE THE THE UH THE OBJECT IS A NOM RIGHT ELEMENT I THINK
TUPLE OR SOMETHING YEAH
WHAT ON THE
OKAY
MM
THAT SHOULD UH TELL YOU WHAT IT IS
I'LL TAKE A LOOK AT THAT
YEAH
IS THERE SOMETHING THAT I SHOULD
SO W IS THERE UM DID YOU HAVE YOU MADE UH ANOTHER M. BROWSER
UM THERE IS BUT I W I HAVEN'T MADE A LOT OF CHANGES TO IT
OKAY
RIGHT
SO I MIGHT JUST UM DELETE WHAT I'VE DONE AND COPY AGAIN FROM YOURS
OH REALLY
I THOUGHT YOU SAID OKAY
UM YEAH SO IF YOU ALTHOUGH THERE'S STUFF OUT THERE THAT ACTUALLY I'M GONNA TRY AND MINIMISE THE AMOUNT OF CHANGES I MAKE TO M. BROWSER ANYWAYS
NO OKAY
OKAY
OH RIGHT I SEE
ALRIGHT YEAH OKAY
SHOULDN'T UM
SINCE FRIDAY
OKAY COOL
'CAUSE I'M SURE YOU'VE PROBABLY MADE SOME CHANGES ALREADY
ALRIGHT
I THOUGHT YOU SAID THAT YOU HAD WRITTEN SOME THINGS THAT MAYBE HAVE CAUSED SOME BUGS AND THAT YOU WERE GONNA FIX THOSE ON THE WEEKEND OR SOMETHING
BUT I WILL TONIGHT THAT'S THE POINT
NOT SINCE YOU LOOKED AT IT LAST NO
NO
AFTER THE WEEKEND
WEEKEND WAS OUT
UM DO WE WANT SEPARATE RESULT PANES UH FOR EACH OF THOSE
OR DO WE WANT THEM ALL IN ONE PANE WITH LIKE AN ICON OR A DIFFERENT COLOUR OR SOMETHING TO INDICATE WHAT TYPE OF RESULT THEY ARE
SO THAT WHEN THEY YOU KNOW CLICK ON THAT IT'S GONNA GO TO THE RELEVANT THING
SUMMARIES
UM LIKE IF WE HAVE TOPICS AS WELL AS TRANSCRIPTS AS WELL AS WHAT WAS THE OTHER
SHOULDN'T BE AN ISSUE
LIKE JUST IF THEY CHECK ALL THREE SAY TOPICS SUMMARIES BLAH BLAH BLAH HAVE THREE DIFFERENT WINDOWS COME UP
ACTUALLY JUST TO CLARIFY LAST WEEK WHEN WE WERE TALKING ABOUT OUR SEARCH RESULTS
MM-HMM YEAH YEAH
OR THREE LIKE SUB SUB PANES SORT OF
WHAT'S THERE KIND OF WHAT ARE YOU THINKING
WELL AT THE MOMENT IS THERE AT THE MOMENT IS THERE A WINDOW THAT COMES UP
OR IS THERE YOU KNOW DOES THE WINDOW GET LARGER
OR IS THAT A R A SECOND RESULTS PANE
UM
WHAT UM I THOUGHT WHAT WE SORTA DISCUSSED LAST WEEK WAS TO HAVE IT SORT UM THE SAME WINDOW
UM I DON'T KNOW IF WE STILL WANNA KEEP IT THAT WAY BUT THAT'S UH THAT'S WHAT I WAS GONNA BE WORKING
SO SO IT'S JUST LIKE YOU CLICK THOSE AND IT'S JUST LOADS UP
ONE TWO OR THREE DEPENDING ON WHICH ONES YOU CHECK
AND THEN UM SO IF WE WANNA DO IT THAT WAY YOU KNOW LIKE IT PROBABLY DOESN'T MATTER TOO MUCH
JUST TRYING TO THINK IF THERE'S GONNA BE ANY OTHER ISSUES DOWN THE ROAD UM DEPENDING ON
YOU KNOW SPLITS THAT THING INTO LIKE TWO OR THREE OR WHATEVER THAT IS
UM SO IT'LL BE ON THE SEARCH WINDOW BOTTOM HALF OF THE SEARCH WINDOW
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
UM
YEAH
WHAT HAVE TH TH UH YOU CONFUSE ME
DO YOU HAVE UM THREE SEPARATE WINDOWS FOR THE THREE SEPARATE DIFFERENT TYPES OF RESULTS
NO NO
SO FOR ONE FOR TOPICS ONE FOR I DON'T NOT REALLY TABS
SO SO IT'S JUST WHEN WE CLICK YOU KNOW TOPICS AND SUMMARIES FOR WHAT WE WANNA SEARCH
NO JUST JUST PANES JUST RESULT PANES FOR EACH OF THE THREE NO NO NO NO NO
THEN IT'LL UH YOU KNOW THERE'LL BE TWO RESULT PANES
UM BUT THEN YOU CAN'T SEE ALL OF THEM AT THE SAME TIME AND IT'S JUST LIKE
YEAH
OKAY
RIGHT YEP
OKAY NOT NOT THREE DIFFERENT OKAY OKAY COOL
POP UPS
YEAH
YEAH
OR TABS OR SOMETHING
YEAH I QUITE LIKE THE IDEA OF A TAB IN THAT CASE
ALL OF THEM NO
BUT YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO COMPARE THE RESULT THE TOPIC ONE TOPIC RESULT WITH ONE SUMMARY RESULT WOULD YOU
WELL IT'S NO BUT THE THING IS IF YOU'RE LOOKING IF YOU COULD CHECK THEM BOTH UM YOU WANNA SEE ALL THE RESULTS
ESPECIALLY IF YOU GET IF YOU GET RESULTS FOR THE SAME MEETING
ACTUALLY MM YEAH
YEAH YEAH IT'S THREE PANES
YEAH EXACTLY
SO THE SUMMARY AND THE TOPIC AND THE TRANSCRIPT ARE UM SO UM OR WE COULD JUST PUT THEM ALL INTO ONE RESULT PANE ON THAT SAME WINDOW AND JUST INDICATE
YEAH
MAYBE YEAH YEAH
YEAH YEAH IT'S TRUE
I MEAN WE COULD WE COULD ORDER THEM BY MEETING FOR EXAMPLE
YEAH
BUT THAT'S A HASSLE TOO
YEAH
YEAH
OH YEAH I GUESS THAT WAS THE OTHER THING WHETHER WE WANNA HAVE THIS REORDER BY COLUMNS AND ALL THAT
IT'S A LOT OF WORK
HOW TO ORDER IT
YEAH WELL I MEAN UH IF YOU KNOW THAT'S UH YOU EVEN A SECOND STEP THE FIRST QUESTION IS DO WE WANT TO ORDER THEM
HOW DO WE WANNA ORDER THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE
SO YEAH THAT KINDA MAKES MOST SENSE
I THINK YEAH PROBABLY BY MEETING MAKES MOST SENSE
I MEAN ESSENTIALLY THEY'RE TEM YOU KNOW IN TIME ORDER
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH MAYBE WE SHOULD DO THAT
LEAST UH
SHOULD BE AN EASY NO I DON'T KNOW ACTUALLY
SHOULD BE FAIRLY EASY I GUESS
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH M WHY DON'T YOU JUST UM
COLOUR CODE THOSE
YEAH
THE RESULTS TO THREE DIFFERENT COLOURS
AND THEN IF WE'RE HIGHLIGHTING SOMETHING IN A TRANSCRIPT WINDOW
SO LET'S THERE'S YEAH
THINKING SOMETIMES IN A CASE LIKE THAT LIKE A RUN ACROSS UM IN OTHER LANGUAGES
IT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO GET THAT INFORMATION BACK ONCE IT'S JUST IN A LIST BOX AN ITEM IN A LIST BOX
JUST THAT IT'S HARD TO TELL WHAT KIND OF OBJECT IT WAS ORIGINALLY ONCE IT'S PUT INTO LIKE A LIST BOX OR SOMETHING
IT'S HARD TO TELL WHETHER IT WAS A A TRANSCRIPT OR WHATEVER
WHEREAS IF IT'S COMING FROM
NO BUT IF YOU
ROCK BOTTOM LEV LEVEL SAYING IF TH IF YOU FOUND A SEGMENT THEN COLOUR IT PRINT IT IN RED OR WHATEVER AND
AND THEN THERE'S SOME IF STATEMENT SAYING S STRAIGHT ON THE YOU KNOW
IF YOU IF YOU DO IT STRAIGHT FROM YOU KNOW YOU GET TH YOU GET THE RESULT
YEAH
RIGHT
YEAH
IT'S JUST SILLY
YEAH
AS OPPOSED TO
AND IT JUST DOESN'T LET YOU SAVE CERTAIN THINGS AND IT'S JUST KINDA UM TRYING TO TO DO A DIFFERENT KIND OF TO GO TO A DIFFERENT WINDOW
AND UH
YEAH
AT THAT POINT THAT'S SORTA WHERE IT STARTS GETTING A LITTLE BIT TRICKY
UM YEAH IT'S JUST LIKE FROM PAST EXPERIENCE I'VE THERE'S GOOFY LITTLE THINGS THAT HAPPEN
SO IF YOU WANNA GO TO THE ACTUAL HIGHLIGHT THE TRANSCRIPT OR HIGHLIGHT THE TOPIC OR HIGHLIGHT THE SUMMARY
'CAUSE YOU'RE WORKING WITH AN EVENT HANDLER WITHIN THE ONE PANEL OR LIST BOX OR WHATEVER IT IS
OH RIGHT
WELL HAVE A LOOK
AH
OH MM-HMM
YEAH YEAH I CAN IMAGINE
OH OH I SEE YEAH
OR DELEGATES OR WHATEVER THE ALL THAT STUFF
SO UM THERE ARE WAYS AROUND IT BUT YOU KNOW WHETHER I'LL BE ABLE TO FIGURE SOMETHING OUT LIKE THAT TILL BEFORE TOMORROW YEAH I KNOW
SO ANYWAYS
YOU YOU HAVE TO USE ACTIONS
UM YEAH I MEAN UM AT THE MOMENT IT WORKS IT WORKS WITH HIGHLIGHTING IN IN THE TRANSCRIPT WINDOW DOESN'T IT
RIGHT
I THINK SO
SO
UM WASN'T JONATHAN SAYING SOMETHING ABOUT THAT
I THINK IT WAS JUST LIKE AS LONG AS WE IMPLEMENT ONE OF THESE INTERFACES FOR THIS PARTICULAR TYPE OF WINDOW
LIKE HIGHLIGHTING THE YEAH
I THINK HE WAS SAYING THAT AS LONG AS WE IMPLEMENT THAT UM INTERFACE UM IT SHOULD WORK WITH ANYTHING THAT WE DO
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT HIGHLIGHTING HAPPEN
I DON'T KNOW
I THINK THAT WAS UM WHO IS SAYING THAT
I DON'T
WHAT DO YOU MEAN IT SHOULD WORK WITH ANYTHING
MM-HMM
ANYWAYS
OKAY
SO I AM NOT SURE WHAT IT'S CALLED NOW
UM
YEAH I MEAN THE WHOLE UM THE M WHAT FILLS THE TRANSCRIPTION BOX AND ALL OF THESE BOXES IS A SPECIAL SORT OF PANE MADE BY NITE
OKAY
UM SOME
SO MAYBE IT COMES WITH SOMETHING CLEVER AS WELL
AS I SAID YOU KNOW IF YOU IF YOU LEFT CLICK ON SOMETHING FOR EXAMPLE IT HIGHLIGHTS AUTOMATICALLY
AND THAT COMES WITH A WHOLE LOAD OF HIGHLIGHTING EXTRAS AS WELL
UM NO BUT I KNOW WHAT IT'S CALLED
ALRIGHT
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY MAYBE I SHOULD MAYBE I SHOULD USE THAT AS WELL IN MY YEAH OKAY
YEAH
IT'S CALLED A NITE TEXT PANE OR SOMETHING ISN'T IT
IS IT
NITE
NO I'M SURE IT HASN'T GOT PANE IN IT
YEAH WHY WHAT'S NOM ANYWAY
NITE OH
I DON'T KNOW TEXT TEXT YEAH SOMETHING LIKE THAT
MIGHT YEP
NOM TEXT THERE IS ALRIGHT
TEXT AREA OR SOMETHING SOMETHING LIKE THAT YEAH
HMM
MOSTLY THINGS ARE CALLED NOM
YEAH
NOM TEXT YEAH
YEAH WHY
YEAH
NITE OBJECT MODEL I THINK THAT'S WHAT
NITE OBJECT MODEL I THINK
OKAY THAT MAKES SENSE
WHAT DO YOU SAY
OKAY
MM
WITH THE UM
ANYBODY
'CAUSE UM I WAS WONDERING HOW WE'RE GONNA WRITE IT BACK TO H. T. M. L. I MEAN X. M. L. IF WE TAKE IF WE DID THE PROCESSING
THE REMOVING THE DISFLUENCIES HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING WITH THAT YET
NO
NO WE HAVEN'T
UM
WRITING IT BACK TO X. M. L.
LIKE NOT EV NOT AS X. M. L. JUST SORT OF AS A WAS THAT WHAT WAS THAT UM WHAT TRANSCRIPTS RECENT OH NO
TRANSCRIPT NO 'CAUSE THEN WE NEED ALL THE OTHER DATA IF WE WANNA KEEP IT A TRANSCRIPT RIGHT
IT'S I THOUGHT WE WERE JUST GOING TO HAVE THAT AS WORDS
SEEMS
THERE'S A BLOP OF TEXT
TEXT FILE
THERE IS SOME BIZARRE METHOD THAT PUTS THINGS BACK INTO X. M. L. FORMAT
YOU WILL VERY MUCH LIMIT WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH IT IF IT'S NOT IN X. M. L. FORMAT
BUT
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
GOOD POINT
YEAH THAT'S TRUE YEAH
WHY DO YOU WHY DO WE WANT IT IN X. M. L. THERE
I MEAN I THOUGHT WE'D WE'D JUST SELECTIVELY SELECTIVELY WRITE THE X. M. L. THAT WE'VE GOT
WHAT
SO AS AS OPPOSED TO
YEAH
YEAH
OH SELECT WHAT WE WANT JUST TAKE BITS OF THE X. M. L. AND TAKE ONLY IT TAKES CERTAIN SEGMENTS
YEAH T
HMM
NOT NOT STORE IT AT ALL WHATSOEVER
AT THE MOMENT IT PRINTS OUT ALL OF THEM
YEAH ONLY ONLY PRINT OUT CERTAIN UM CERTAIN SEGMENTS THE SEGMENTS THAT WE WANT JUST SELECTIVELY
WE'LL JUST PUT AN IF LOOP IN IT THAT LEAVES OUT SOME OF THE PRINT STATEMENTS
YEAH LIKE
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
ALRIGHT
YEAH YEAH
OKAY YEAH YEAH
CERTAIN SEGMENTS
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
THAT
YEAH I KNOW
OKAY THEN THAT'S THEN THAT'S NOT YEAH
ACTUALLY BUT THIS MAKES MORE SENSE
OH YEAH
THAT'S SORTA WHAT WE WERE THINKING BEFORE
YEAH THAT'S WHAT AND THAT'S WHAT I THINK WE LIKE
BECAUSE
IT SAYS SOMETHING DIFFERENT THERE
THAT'S WHAT
OKAY
OH RIGHT
BUT THAT WILL MEAN THAT YOU CAN ONLY DO THINGS ON ACTUALLY NO UH 'CAUSE YOU NEED TO DO THINGS ON WORD LEVEL
THEN WRITTEN TO A WRITTEN TO A FILE
SO YEAH THAT'S FINE
I KINDA DOUBT JUST THAT IT WOULD EVER BE DONE
YEAH
YEAH IF WE'RE GONNA DO THE X. M. L. THEN FINE THAT'S THAT PROBABLY MAKES IT EASIER
YEAH
I MEAN WE'RE NOT REALLY UH WELL I MEAN
WE'RE NOT GONNA DO MUCH MORE THAN JUST LOOK AT THE
THE REM LIKE THE TEXT PROBLEM WITH DISFLUENCIES 'CAUSE WE'RE NOT GONNA SEARCH IT AND WE'RE NOT GONNA LIKE LISTEN TO IT
YEAH
MM-HMM
SINCE WE'RE NOT DOING THE AUDIO THING
YEAH
BUT WELL ANYWAY YEAH
SO I GUESS JUST TO DISPLAYING IT IS A ALRIGHT
SO WHAT
IT'S FINE
YEAH
AS TEXT YOU MEAN
YEAH YEAH YOU DON'T REALLY NEED TO DO MUCH MORE WITH IT
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
NO
YEAH BUT IT WOULD
CREATE A TEXT FILE TAKE THE DISFLUENCIES OUT OF THE TEXT FILE AND THEN YEAH
THE THING IS LIKE WELL HOW WOULD WE DISPLAY THE LIKE IF WE DO TAKE DISFLUENCIES OUT AND JUST C YOU KNOW
IT WON'T LOOK LIKE IT WON'T SAY SPEAKER X. SAYS THIS SPEAKER Y. SAYS THAT SPEAKER Z. SAYS THIS
AND
IT WOULD JUST BE BLURB LIKE A SUMMARY
WELL THAT IS TRUE
YEAH
UNLESS WE EXTRACT THAT OUT OF THE FILE WHEN WE CREATE THE TEXT FILE
THAT'S TRUE TOO
YEAH
UNLESS YOU WANT AS DARK COLOURING
THEN IT WILL LOOK UGLY PROBABLY 'CAUSE IT WILL LOOK JUST BLACK AND WHITE
IT'S PROBABLY BEST AND DO AS YOU SAID
NO
NO
LIKE JUST LIKE YEAH
IT'S JUST ANOTHER UM I MEAN THESE MEETINGS ARE NOT ENDLESSLY LONG IT'S JUST WORDS AND TO PRINT ALL OF THEM OUT SELECTIVELY
I DON'T THINK IT'S GONNA TAKE LONG TO TO PRODUCE ANYWAY
NO NO I DON'T THINK THAT'S I THINK IT'S TRUE
YEAH
SO
IT DOES IT ON THE FLY ANYWAY DIDN'T IT
YEAH
SO THEN JUST GOES THROUGH IT AND SAYS IF THIS WORD EQUALS THAT THEN PRINT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
UM
JUST A BUNCH OF IF STATEMENTS IS
YOU COULD NEARLY DO IT TOGETHER WITH WITH UH THE TRANSCRIPTION WITH THE ORIGINAL TRANSCRIPTION HAVE THEM RUN PARALLEL
YEAH
BUT I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S YOU KNOW FANCY BUT
PRINT IT ON BOTH BOTH PANES AND IF IT'S NOT A PROPER WORD THEN PRINT IT ONLY ON ONE
SO IF CERTAIN YOU KNOW IF IT'S A PROPER WORD
MM-HMM
BUT UM
YOU JUST FATTEN THE CODE OUT A BIT
I IT WOULD BE THE SAME THING
YEAH YOU PROBABLY COULD ACTUALLY
THIS IS PROBABLY AND THAT'S PROBABLY NOT THAT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT
YEAH
YEAH
BUT THEN
YOU KNOW THE CHOP FILE THEN YOU DON'T EVER HAVE TO PRODUCE IT
YOU KNOW THE THE B THE GOOD WAY OF DOING IT UM NOT TOGETHER IS THAT YOU IF SOMEONE DOESN'T WANNA LOOK AT THE THE
AND THEY CAN'T YEAH EXACTLY
IF IT'S GONNA TAKE TOO LONG WE'LL THINK ABOUT WRITING IT TO A FILE AND DOING IT OFF LINE
YOU CAN WRITE WE CAN WRITE SOMETHING LIKE UM WE'LL TRY AND DO IT ON THE FLY AND AND OBSERVE IF IF THAT GONNA IS GONNA TAKE TOO LONG
SO BUT I MEAN YOU CAN YOU KNOW
RIGHT
THIS IS LOADS OF IF STATEMENTS
IT'S JUST UH THEY'D JUST BE IF STATEMENTS WHEN THEY FAST IF STATEMENTS AREN'T THEY
SHOULDN'T NO
YEAH
YEAH I UM
BUT UH THAT MIGHT EVEN BE AN EASIER WAY
I MEAN TO PROCESS X. M. L. INTO LIKE IN JUST CREATES WHATEVER FILE IT'S GONNA BE IN
YEAH
ALTHOUGH ON THE FLY IT'S TYPIC IT'S IT'S TYPICALLY PRETTY FUN
FLIP IT INTO UH YEAH JUST UH TRANSFORMS UM LIKE UM STYLE SHEET THE UM X. M. L. STYLE SHEET
I DON'T KNOW DO WELL WE DON'T WANNA HAVE TO DO THAT RIGHT
AND THEN IT'S KINDA LIKE THERE'S USUALLY THINGS BUILT IN TO WELL SHOULD BE BUILT INTO JAVA
I WAS JUST THINKING AS WELL I MEAN WE COULD PROBABLY EVEN USE LIKE X. S. L. T. TO KINDA JUST TRANSFORM IT AND YOU KNOW
UH IT'S BEEN A F COUPLE OF YEARS SINCE I'VE LOOKED INTO ANYTHING LIKE THIS
AND THEN THAT WAY WE COULD EVEN PRE PROCESS THAT BEFORE HAND
OR I DON'T KNOW
WELL IS THAT
OH RIGHT
I GAVE UP DOING THAT COMPLETELY AND JUST DEFAULTED BACK TO N UH NITE STUFF 'CAUSE IT WAS MUCH MUCH MUCH EASIER
I WOULDN'T WANNA HAVE TO PUT IT TAKE TO PUT IT BACK INTO X. M. L. WITH JAVA
EVEN TRYING TO READ IT IN X. M. L. WITH JAVA WAS COMPLICATED ENOUGH
OKAY
OH REALLY
OH RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
OTHERWISE YOU'RE GONNA BE S JAVA TRYING TO DO S IT WAS JUST SO COMPLICATED IT WAS RIDICULOUS
SO IF WE CAN DO IT WITH NITE STUFF DO IT WITH NITE STUFF I THINK
YEAH
YEAH OKAY
YEAH
OKAY
DON'T BELIEVE IT
YOU HAVE TO D START DEFINING OBJECT MODELS LIKE THE NITE THING AND GETTING ALL BIZARRE W WEIRD THINGS
IT WAS MAD
ARE YOU SERIOUS
YEAH OKAY
IT'S INSANE
'CAUSE IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE ALL THE TOOLS THERE AND JUST LIKE HAVE THE OBJECT MODEL AND JUST KIND OF LIKE PLUG AND PLAY WITH EVERYTHING AND JUST TO ACTUALLY USE THE SYSTEM
IT'D BE NICE TO JUST SORTA SEE WHAT THEY'RE DOING
ACTUALLY I WAS THINKING I MIGHT TRY AND TALK TO WHO IS IT JONATHAN AND JEAN
LIKE JUST TO SEE H WHAT THEY WHAT SYSTEM THEY USED TO DEVELOP THIS STUFF
YOU KNOW AT A HIGHER LEVEL RATHER THAN KINDA YOU KNOW
SO I MIGHT UH TRY AND CONTACT THEM SEE IF THERE'S I DON'T KNOW
PLAYING AROUND WITH A LITTLE BIT OF CODE AND MODIFYING THEIR CODE AND DOING THIS AND THAT
MM
HMM
ANY OTHER HINTS THEY COULD GIVE US
JUST TO GET THINGS I DON'T KNOW MOVING AT A HIGHER LEVEL I GUESS
IT SEEMS IT'D BE MORE INTERESTING TO USE IT AS A A REAL DEVELOPER WOULD
'CAUSE JUST SEEMS LIKE A LITTLE TINKERING HERE AND THERE AND JUST ADDING COUPLE THINGS AND I DON'T KNOW
SO
THAT'S WHAT PROGRAMMING IS ALL ABOUT I'M AFRAID
A CHANNEL
YEAH
N NO NO IT SHOULDN'T BE NO
YEAH
IT SHOULD BE HIGHER LEVEL
I DON'T KNOW
IT SHOULD BE CONCEPTUAL AND YOU KNOW COMING UP WITH THE THE BRILLIANT IDEAS AND THEN JUST YEAH BRINGING THOSE TO REALITY
YEAH
THAT'S THE HIGHER PEOPLE
MAYBE
I HAVE A FRIEND THERE TOO
WELL I MEAN
I I PERSONALLY DON'T WANNA MESS WITH UH WRITING FILES OR ANYTHING THE MOMENT
YEAH WHY DON'T YOU PUT BOTH OF BOTH OF THOSE IDEAS IN INTO THAT THAT PARAGRAPH AND SAY YOU'LL HAVE A LOOK AT BOTH OR SOMETHING
IF YOU WANNA DO IT
I WANNA DO IT SUPERFICIALLY
HMM
HMM
YEAH
TEXT FILE OR X. M. L. OR WHATEVER IT IS
IT'S LIKE HMM IF IT'S FAST ENOUGH ON THE FLY THEN SURE
IT'S FILE
BUT YEAH JUST I DON'T KNOW JUST IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE REALLY EITHER WAY TO ME
LIKE THE THING THAT I WAS THINKING THERE IS WELL IS THAT ONCE IT'S DONE FOR A F YOU KNOW ONE MEETING IT'S DONE AND IT'S THERE
UM THAT'S ABOUT THE ONLY ISSUE I HAVE WITH ON THE FLY WHETHER IT'S FAST ENOUGH
YEAH
YEAH
I SPOKE TO
HMM
ESPECIALLY WITH JAVA AND ALL THIS OTHER CRAP
IT'S JUST IF IT'S LOADING THE FILE AND DOING ALL THE REST AND PROCESSING THE P
WELL IT HAS ALREADY LEARNED IT ANYWAY

MAYBE YOU COULD SPLIT THAT UP AND
UM OH LIKE INTO EACH SEPARATE I KNOW YEAH
I THINK YOU LOSE THE
YEAH LIKE HERE IS WHAT WE'VE DONE ALREADY AND THEN YOU KNOW DOWN HERE
SO YOU TALK ABOUT SPEAKER CHARACTERISATION YOU SAY WHAT YOU'VE DONE AND
BUT SOMETIMES IT'S EASIER TO HAVE THE TOP IT IN ITS OWN ITS SECTIONS IF YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN
THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING
YOU MIGHT LOSE A BIT OF CONTINUITY IF YOU DO THAT THOUGH
YEAH
YEAH ACT
MM
YEAH
OKAY
BUT MAYBE AT THE END MAYBE JUST UH A POINT FORM OF YOU KNOW THINGS THAT WE'RE STILL WORKING ON THINGS THAT WE'LL DO

WHAT
HUH
OKAY
YEAH
SNORE

DOESN'T MATTER
YEAH OKAY ACTUALLY NO NO N ACTUALLY THAT'S A GOOD IDEA I'LL TAKE ONE QUICK LOOK OVER

YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
OH
UM YEAH TWELVE THIRTY TOMORROW WITH
I WRITE WROTE LIKE FOUR LINES OF WHATEVER
OH
IT'S SAD
I HAVE
OKAY
OH OH RIGHT OKAY
S STEVE O.
STEVE
OH GOD
YEAH
YEAH
WELL I THOUGHT YOU HAD TOMORROW OFF
NOT MUCH WITHOUT ANY OF US
TWELVE DAYS AND WRITE YEAH
DOES IT SQUEEZE IN AYE LIKE THAT
YEAH
OOPS
'KAY
OKAY
RIGHT
DID YOU WANNA TAKE A LOOK AT COMMENTS
HMM
THERE'S MORE UH
DID WE GET SEVEN OUT OF TEN FOR THE OTHER ONE
YEP
IT'S GOING UH
YEAH
OKAY
OH
EXCELLENT
OKAY
SURE
OKAY RIGHT SEE YA
OKAY
OKAY
JUST SAID THE SAME THINGS YOU JUST SAID
YEAH
YEP
MM
'KAY
SO HOW WE'RE GETTING ALONG
NOT BAD
LIKE IF YOU'RE IN A TOPIC AND IT GOES AND HIGHLIGHTS THE TOPIC IN THE TEXT OR WHATEVER
IS THERE A PARTICULAR TYPE OF CONTROL THAT LIKE IS THERE ONE OF THESE N. X. T. OR SORRY UM NITE CONTROLS
UM ONE THING THAT I WAS WONDERING IS THERE A STANDARD CONTROL THAT YOU USE TO CONNECT THE DIFFERENT THINGS
N. O. M. OR
IN TEXT AREA IS THAT WHAT IT IS
JUST BECAUSE UM THE THE TOPIC BOX AND ALL THIS IS UM IS BASED ON UM OH WHAT'S IT CALLED NOM NO NITE TEXT AREA OR SOMETHING
SO YOU SHOULD PROBABLY LOOK AT THE
UM IT HAS SOME SORT OF HIGHLIGHTING STUFF THERE
UM I THINK THERE IS
OKAY
UM
I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S IN BUILT THOUGH TO BE HONEST
YOU HAVEN'T HAD TO BUILD ANY NEW WINDOWS TO DO THAT SORT OF THING
MM
OR NO
WELL OKAY UM WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SPEAKER CHARACTERIZATION HOW ARE WE ACCESSING THE LIST OF SPEAKERS
LIKE OTHER TOPICS OR WELL WE'RE GONNA DO ONE FOR SPEAKER I GUESS AND ALL THE REST RIGHT
NO
WHAT WHAT WHAT WH WH
T UH I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THAT ACTUALLY
SO AND THEN THEY WR IT WRITES OBJECTS AND THE OBJECTS CONTAIN ALL THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE MEETINGS AND THE SPEAKERS
ONE THAT REPRESENTS THE MEETINGS AND THE MEET AND THE INFORMATION ABOUT BOTH IS CONTAINED WITHIN EACH OBJECT
AND THEN YOU CAN CALL METHODS TO RETURN WHATEVER YOU WANT
SO THAT THE WHO THE SPEAKERS THAT ARE AT THE MEETINGS AND THE AMOUNT THEY SPEAK AND THEN THE AVERAGES ARE CONTAINED WITH THE SPEAKERS
AND THEY ALL THEY'RE TWO DIFFERENT OBJECTS
NO NOT REALLY
IF SOMEO IF YOU WANNA DO THAT THEN THEN TELL ME HOW YOU WANT THE DATA PRESENTED HOW THE 'CAUSE DO YOU WANT ME TO TELL YOU
OR EVERYTHING BUT THAT'S WHY I WANTED TO KNOW HOW HO WHAT'S THE EASIEST WAY TO HAVE THE DATA
SO THERE'S TWO SEPARATE CLASS AREN'T THERE
UM THIS SPEAKER UM THE DATA PROCESSING IS FINE BUT UH WE DON'T PARTICULARLY WANT TO DO THE B THE THE B THE GUI FOR IT
AND YOU CAN RECALL THEY CAN WRITE THE IT WRITES THE OBJECTS AND THEN YOU CALL THE OBJECTS BACK AND THEY HA THOSE RETURNED OBJECTS HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED
OKAY LIKE 'CAUSE AT THE MOMENT THE THE THE THERE IS I'VE CREATED TWO CLASSES ONE THAT REPRESENTS SPEAKERS
YOU DON'T
YEAH I W I WAS THINKING ABOUT UH I WAS GOING THAT DIRECTION ANYWAY
OKAY I'LL DO IT
OKAY
RIGHT
YEAH THAT
OKAY YEAH
SO
I THINK
I THINK
OKAY YEAH I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN
SO UM I UH HAVE YOU ALREADY CALCULATED ALL THIS DATA OR ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO DO THAT
OH RIGHT
HMM
'CAUSE IT CAN COME BACK AS A ALMOST ANYTHING
UM WHICH MEANS THAT YOU JUST RET CALL CONSTRUCTOR AND CALL THE LOAD THING AND CALL IT THERE AND YOU CAN CREATE A LIST OF THEM OR A VECTOR OF THEM OR WHATEVER YOU WANNA DO
YEAH SUPPOSEDLY ALL CALCULATED YEAH
WHAT'S EASIEST TO DISPLAY ON THE SCREEN
BUT THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO HOW Y HOW WHAT FORMAT DO YOU WANT THE DATA TO COME BACK IN
AND THEN OR JUST CALL THEM ONE AT A TIME TO POPULATE WINDOW
UM AND ALL STORED AS OBJECTS SO DOT OBJECT FILES
YEAH
OKAY
ALRIGHT
OKAY
OKAY
UH WHAT SHOULD IT COME BACK AS
YEAH
WHATEVER
LIKE WHEN HE WAS TALKING ABOUT LIKE HAVE AN ARCHITECTURE THAT THINGS ARE GONNA PLUG INTO
OR WHAT ELSE ARE WE DOING
I MEAN SEARCH RESULTS IF THEY'RE ALL IN A PREDICTABLE THING WITH A NAME CERTAIN PROPERTIES OR A LIST OF PROPERTIES A VECTOR
UM ACTUALLY EVEN THE SEARCHES OR WHATEVER YOU KNOW JUST ANY SORT OF THING
UM
I MEAN SO THAT THINGS ARE ALL MODULAR I MEAN IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA IF WE USED THAT SAME IDEA FOR ANYTHING ELSE WE DO
ACTUALLY I KNOW THAT MIGHT ALSO HELP
NUMBERS
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH CA YOU COULD
IT WILL SAY VECTOR THIS COU I DON'T KNOW WHATEVER
ONE'S PERCENT NOISE AND ONE IS PERCENT PARTICIPATION
SO AND THEN IT'S GOT INSIDE IT'S GOT A LINK FOR IT'S GOT A IT'S GOT THE N SPEAKER'S NAME AND THEN IT'S GOT THEIR PERCENTAGE FOR THAT THING
UH JUST A STRING IS NOISE W X. PERCENT
YEAH
W YOU CAN EITHER HAVE IT TH YOU COULD EITHER HAVE IT YOU COULD I HAVE IT LIKE AN EMBEDDED IN VECTOR OR ARRAY OF STRINGS AND EACH ONE REPRESENTS ONE PERSON OR WHATEVER
SO UM SO I CAN HAVE IT SO THAT IT RETURNS YOU A 'CAUSE AT THE MOMENT THE MAIN DATA STRUCTURES ARE HASH TABLES FOR THE MEETINGS THAT SAY IT'S GOT ONE THAT SAYS PERCENT IT'S CALLED PERCENT TALK
YEAH
SO IT CAN EITHER COME BACK AS A YOU CAN HAVE THE HASH TABLE OR YOU CAN HAVE IT RETURNED AS A VECTOR AND IT WILL SAY NOISE
DO YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
WHAT THE WHAT THE EASIEST THING DEC HOW HOW YOU WANNA DISPLAY IT
OH YEAH
MM RIGHT
I MEAN UM
UM WHATEVER YOU GIVE ME I CAN DO IT I THINK
H UM YEAH
JUST A MATTER OF DECIDING WHAT WE WHAT WOULD BE EASIEST ALL THE WAY AROUND I MEAN
YEAH
UM
EXACTLY
YEAH EXACTLY
UM SO WHAT WILL WHENEVER WE OPEN A WINDOW FOR ONE SPEAKER UM
YEAH
SEE THAT'S THE CA HOW DID WE CAN I HAVE A LOOK AT THAT AGAIN
IT'S SPEAKER SPEAKER IS THE UH CONTROLLING THING NOT YEAH YEAH OKAY YEAH YEAH
JUST SPEND TOO MUCH TIME TALKING TO BRITS
ALL I HAVE TO DO IS GET THE DIALOGUE ACTS
YEAH
OKAY
THAT WAS BIZARRE THING
I DON'T THINK THAT'LL BE DIFFICULT
SOME ARE QUITE AMUSING ACTUALLY
SO ALL OF THIS UH ALL THAT'S CALCULATED AS WELL STORED AS SPEAKER OBJECTS
THE UH THE INFLUENCES OF I LIVED IN GERMANY FOR SIX MONTHS DON'T KNOW IF THAT HAD ANY EFFECT
SO THEN THE ALL THAT'S CALCULATED AS WELL
WHERE DID THESE PEOPLE COME FROM
YEAH THAT'S THAT'S EASY
S IF IT'S IN THAT FORMAT IT'S SPEAKER
YEAH YEAH
SH PRETTY MUCH I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
YEP
DEFINITELY
YEP
OH IS IT
OH
OKAY
RIGHT
STRANGE
RIGHT
UM
SO THEN DOES THIS HOW DOES IS HOW IS THIS BOX POPULATED
IS IT POPULATED BY THE ONE PRESENT OR THE ONE HIGHLIGHTED
UM THE ONE PRESENT
ALTHOUGH WE COULD DO TH MM WE COULD DO THE ONE HIGHLIGHTED I SUPPOSE
THE ONE PRESENT OKAY
HMM
SO THAT W COULD CALL THAT WOULD CALL THAT AND CALL THE MEETINGS METHOD THAT SAID RETURN THAT
AND THAT WOULD POPULATE THAT WHICH SHOULD BE AN EASY THING TO DO
SO THAT'S AND IT SAYS LIKE GET GET TALK TIME AND YOU AND Y IT TAKES A NAME
UM AND THE SAME FOR THAT COMES OUT THERE
'CAUSE AT THE MOMENT I'M USING THERE IS THERE ARE METHODS THAT SAY UM FOR THE USING FOR OTHER TALKS
HMM
MM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
SO DO YOU WANNA DO THAT THEN
AND UM AND IT WOULD COME UP WITH HOW MUCH THEY SPOKE AND YOU CAN PICK THE ONE THAT S LOOKS THE MOST INTERESTING
THAT YOU WANNA SEE PER TOPIC YOU WANNA SEE WHICH ONE SPOKEN MOST SOMETHING LIKE THAT
I MEAN THAT WOULD UM THAT WOULD BE UM IMPLEMENTING WHAT YOU SAID
SO YOU COULD YOU COULD ZAP THROUGH THESE TOPICS UH MEETINGS SORRY
MEETINGS
YEAH YEAH
YEP
YEAH YEAH THAT WOULD BE EASY AS WELL YEAH
MM-HMM
SO I'LL W I'LL JUST LEAVE IN LOTS OF METHODS THAT ST THAT'LL JUST RETURN ONE NUMBER AT A TIME
THAT'LL BE THE EASIEST WAY TO DO YEAH
YEAH OKAY
OKAY YEAH THAT'S FINE
YEAH
YEAH DEFINITELY
YEAH
SO YEAH RANDOM THINGS LIKE JUST LIKE RETURN TALKING TIME
OR
YEAH
GET TALK TIME I THINK IT'S CALLED AT THE MOMENT SOMETHING LIKE THAT YEAH
YEAH
GOOD
YEAH I MEAN
SO EACH TIME ARE YOU GOING STRAIGHT TO THE X. M. L. FILES FOR FOR THE INFORMATION OR RIGHT
OKAY I SEE
OH WELL
OKAY RIGHT
OH I SEE
THEN YOU PR CALL LOAD AND YOU CAN CALL LOAD AND WHATEVER ONE OR ALL OF THEM OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
THEY'RE ONLY LIKE A ONE UM ONE THOU ONE K.
YOU HAVE TO G RE CREATE THE OBJECT
AND THEN UM IF YOU CALL A NULL CONSTRUCTOR
IT'S GOT A LOAD METHOD
NO IT'S STORED AS AN OBJECT FILE
SO WHAT YOU DO IS YOU CALL A NULL CONSTRUCTOR 'CAUSE IF YOU CALL THE TH PROPER CONSTRUCTOR FOR EACH MEETING
GO THROUGH A LIST
IT GOES OFF AND DOES ALL THE PROCESSING AND STORES OWN OBJECT
AND THEN IT'S JUST EACH METHOD OBJECT'S GOT A RETURN BUNCH OF RETURN METHODS
IT PROCESSES A WHOLE LOT OFF LINE AND STORES IT AS AN OBJECT AND THEN THEY'RE MUCH MUCH SMALLER
YEAH IT'S ALL PRE PROCESSED
OKAY
THANKS
RIGHT OKAY
SO IT'S ALL JUST PRE PROCESSED AND JUST OKAY
OKAY
RIGHT
RIGHT
THAT'S COOL
YEAH RIGHT
RIGHT
ALRIGHT
THAT'S NICE
IS THIS IS IT FOR THE ENTIRE CORPUS
OH EACH MEETING OKAY
OR IS IT JUST LIKE INDIVIDUAL ONES LIKE T ONE FI ONE OBJECT FOR OKAY
YEAH
ONE OBJECT FOR EACH MEETING
YEAH
ALTHOUGH YEAH YEAH
ALTHOUGH YOU C
JUST
WONDER IF THAT WOULD BE USEFUL FOR SOME OF THE OTHER STUFF WE'RE DOING
NO NO
NO
WELL YEAH
YEAH
IT'S JUST TELL IT TELLS YOU WHO PARTICIPATED
AT THE MOMENT IT TELLS YOU WHO PARTICIPATED AND THE AMOUNT THEY PARTICIPATED IN PERCENTAGES AND IN TIME AS WELL
RIGHT OKAY
OKAY
CAN YOU PUT IN THERE WHAT TOPIC WAS SPOKEN ABOUT AS WELL
THEN I COULD USE THAT FOR THE FOR THE TOPIC POP UP WINDOW
YEAH YEAH THAT'LL BE PRO THAT'D BE EASY YEAH
YEAH
ALRIGHT
BUT THAT WOULD BE THAT WOULD CAUSE A PROBLEM WITH ANYTHING THAT WASN'T ANNOTATED FOR TOPICS
YEAH IF THAT WON'T BE TOO DIFFICULT
THAT'D BE R
THAT WASN'T WHAT
OR JUST RETURN A NULL OR A BLANK OR A BLANK STRING OR SOMETHING YEAH
YEAH
BUT
THERE ARE SOME THERE ARE SOME DEFAULT ACTUALLY
OH YEAH
NO TOPIC SPECIFIED YEAH HAVE A DEFAULT YEAH
THE UM A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T GET THEIR OWN CH AND OTHER STUFF
YEAH
HMM
ALRIGHT
BECAUSE AT THE MOMENT IF YOU RIGHT CLICK ON A TOPIC WINDOW ON ONE OF THE TOPICS
YOU HAVE THE OPTION OF POP POPPING OPEN A WINDOW WHICH GIVES YOU A LIST OF ALL THE MEETINGS CONTAINING THAT TOPIC
YEAH
SO
YEAH
THEY CAN LOAD EACH O ALL OF THE WHOLE LOT UP AND DO A SEARCH OF THE WHOLE LOT TO FIND WHO BY WHO AND WHAT PROBLEM OR WHAT TOPICS WERE IN WHAT
'CAUSE THAT'S THE THING THESE THESE ARE SO SMALL
OKAY
SO IT DOESN'T CRASH THE THING
AND THEN YOU COULD DO A SEARCH OVER THE MEETINGS OVER THE OBJECTS
Y OH YEAH THAT WOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM
RIGHT
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
IT'S A GOOD IDEA
RIGHT
YEP
WOULD YOU DO THE SUMMARISATION AS YOU POPULATE IT
SO HOW HOW WOULD YOU D HOW WOULD YOU CALCULATE THAT
YOU KNOW JUST YEAH FOR THE GLOBAL
'CAUSE THEY'RE JUST FOR THE METER MET TH THE
WHAT THE GLOBAL STATISTICS COME STRAIGHT OFF OF THAT DON'T THEY
OH RIGHT OKAY
OKAY
OH RIGHT SO OH SO THAT THAT IS ALL STA STORED TOGETHER
THE SPEAKER CLASS KNOWS ABOUT ALL OF THAT STUFF AND THE MEETING CLASS KNOWS ABOUT THAT STUFF
UM
MM JUST GOTTA DECIDE ON WHAT WE WANNA
SO HAVE YOU DONE THESE YET THE NO
SOUNDS GOOD
NO NO BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'LL BE TOO DIFFICULT
WHAT WE WANT YEAH
I THOUGHT THE OTHER STUFF WAS MORE IMPORTANT ANYWAY SO I DID THAT FIRST
UM YEAH DEFINITELY
YEAH
SO IT'S ALL ALL USABLE NOW CAN I DO IT TONIGHT
MM-HMM
IT THE OBJECT'S SERIAL NUMBERS CHANGE AND YOU CAN'T RE LOAD THE OBJECT SO ALL THE PROCESSING HAS TO BE DONE OVER AGAIN
AND I HAVEN'T QUITE FINISHED IT
MM NO DESIGN THE GUI FIRST AND UH 'CAUSE IT IT W THE PROBLEM IS IF YOU CHANGE THE CLASSES
SO
YEAH
HMM
IT WOULD BECOME OUT OF SYNCH AND GET A BIT FUNNY
IF I GAVE YOU ONE IF I GAVE YOU IT ONE AND YOU WORKED ON IT
AND YOU'D HAVE TO AND THEN YOU'D HAVE A V MULTIPLE COPIES OF OBJECTS ALL OVER THE PLACE AND IT'D GET SILLY I THINK
AND THEN I CHANGED IT AND RUN THE THING AGAIN YOU WOULDN'T EVER BE ABLE TO LOAD THE OBJECTS BACK UP
YEAH
OH I SEE
YEAH
YEAH
WELL LET ME KNOW WHEN WHEN IT'S SORT OF USABLE
OR AT LEAST
JU JUST THE THAT YEAH
BUT IF YOU CAN IF YOU WANNA MAKE THE PICTURE C YOU CAN DO THAT WITHOUT ANYTHING I'M PRESUMING
THE TEXT BOX
'CAUSE THAT DOESN'T OKAY
DO YOU MEAN JUST THE YEAH BUT IT'S NOT GONNA TAKE VERY LONG
I MEAN IT'S M YEAH
WHAT DO YOU MEAN A PICTURE
'KAY
ALRIGHT
'CAUSE OTHERWISE THE OBJECTS WON'T BE THE SAME
BUT I THINK I'LL NEED TO HAVE DONE ALL OF THIS STUFF TOO FIRST
WELL IT WON'T TAKE VERY LONG TO GET IT ALL FINISHED
MM
HMM
MM-HMM
SOUNDS GOOD
IS THAT STORED IN THE UH
SO WHERE IS THAT
NO IT'S ON MY HOME DIRECTORY
ON YOUR HOME DIRECTORY NOT IN THE OKAY
WHEN IT'S FINISHED UP GLOBAL OTHERWISE IT WOULD GET CONFUSING
YEAH
NO I HAVEN'T GLOBAL YET
YEAH
YEAH
ACTUALLY I CAN UP LOAD MY STUFF AS WELL I JUST HAVE TO MAKE ONE CHANGE TO YOUR FILE
JUST TO LOAD THIS ONE INSTEAD OF THE THE DEFAULT
SO
SO IT'S TWO LINES OF CODE
YEAH
SOUNDS GOOD
ALRIGHT
IF YOU WANNA CHANGE MY CODE
YEAH
WELL ARE YOU WANTING TO WRITE THAT IN DIRECTLY OR WHAT WHAT DO YOU WANNA DO WITH THAT
UM WHAT DO YOU MEAN
WELL YEAH JUST THE ONE THING THAT'S LIKE THE ACTION FOR LOADING UP THE SEARCH THING
OR YEAH
YOU'RE YEAH BUT ARE YOU DO YOU WANNA CHANGE THAT M THE ORIGINAL M. BROWSER FILE THEN
WELL YOUR VERSION YEAH YEAH
NO
YEAH
YES
I DID IN MY DIRECTORY JUST UH JUST DO THAT YEAH
OR
HAVE YOU DONE THAT NOW
OH OKAY SO NOT THE ACTUAL ONE BUT A COPY OF IT
I'M YEAH
UM I HAVE A COPY YES
BUT I WILL YEAH I WAS GOING TO UPDATE THAT ONE JUST 'CAUSE YEAH IT JUST MAKES SENSE THAT THEN YOU THEN YOU CAN TEST OUT YEAH
RIGHT
OKAY YEAH
NO I JUST
SO OKAY
BECAUSE I USUALLY I USUALLY WORK ON MY OWN COPY FOR FOR THE DAY AND THEN UPDATE IT WITHOUT CHECKING IF TH IF THE ONE IN THE ONE IN THE SHARED ONE HAS CHANGED
WELL JUST JUST TELL ME WHEN
RIGHT YEAH AND THEN UPDATE
YEP
YEAH I HAVEN'T I HAVEN'T MADE ANY CHANGES TO IT YET
SO YEAH
UM YEAH I'LL JUST MAKE THAT ONE AND I'LL LET YOU KNOW
YEAH
YEAH LET ME KNOW
'CAUSE YEAH LIKE I SAY TWO LINES OF CODE IF THAT
BUT HAVE TO GET BETTER RESULTS LIKE BETTER PRESENTED
THERE'S NOT MUCH TO DO YET
SO ANYWAYS UM AND THEN YOU CAN PLAY
YEAH
COOL
SO IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE WORKING ON NOW THEN TO IN TO RIP TO PRESENT THE RESULTS NICE OVERALL
SO UM YEAH THAT'S PR WELL ALSO YEAH LIKE THAT THAT AS WELL
JUST WANNA FIND OUT WHAT KIND OF OBJECTS THOSE WERE THAT UM FOR THE OTHER ONES
YEAH
SO YEAH
SO IT GOES IN AND HIGHLIGHTS 'CAUSE THAT'S I KNOW
YEAH AND JUST UM TO WIRE IN THE THE TOPICS AND UH SUMMARIES
YEAH
OR
YOU MEAN THE HI HIGHLIGHTING STUFF
YEAH
ACTUALLY FOR UM UM FOR AN N. TEXT AREA WHATEVER IT IS UM THEY THEY DEFINED SOME HA HANDY HIGHLIGHTS ON THAT
THEY'VE GOT LIKE USER HIGHLIGHTS UM SELECTION HIGHLIGHTS TIME HIGHLIGHTS AND
YOU'VE GOT JUST LOOK AT THE THE WHAT THEY WROTE ABOUT IT
SO YOU'VE GOT DIFFERENT DIFFERENT HIGHLIGHTS
HMM
OH YEAH
SOMETHING ELSE
SOMETHING LIKE THAT
SO YOU CAN QUITE EASILY IF YOUR TEXT AREA IS CALLED AREA YOU JUST DO AREA DOT SET HIGHLIGHTS OR SOMETHING YOU KNOW
OKAY
RIGHT
THAT'S THE WAY I DID IT TO TO HIGHLIGHT TO CROSS HIGHLIGHT BETWEEN TOPIC AND THEN TRANSCRIPTS
OKAY
OKAY SOUNDS GOOD
SORTA THING
LIKE I'M JUST WONDERING HAVE YOU HAD TO WELL THE WAY YOU'RE DOI I WAS GONNA ASK IF THE WAY YOU WERE DOING IT
UM THEN THAT'S GONNA BE KIND OF FUN
SO YOU DON'T NEED TO JUST UH 'CAUSE IF WE'RE IF WE DO HAVE T LIKE IF THE INVERTED SEARCH SAYS THAT THERE'S YOU KNOW
TEN DOCUMENTS ARE WE GONNA HAVE TO LOAD EACH OF THESE TEN CORP CORPORA JUST TO UM DO THE INDIVIDUAL NEXT UH N. X. T. SEARCH
UM SO YEAH JUST A FEW MORE THINGS TO DO WITH THAT AND THEN UH ONCE PERNILLA GETS THE UH THE INDEX
YOU WERE LOADING LIKE A NEW CORPUS EACH TIME FOR EACH MEETING BUT YOU'RE DOING THE OBJECTS
THAT WAY IT DOESN'T CRASH IF YOU TRY AND LOAD ALL TEN IN ONE IT CRASHES DOESN'T IT
'CAUSE THEN IT'S ABOUT THE AMOUNT THAT EACH IF YOU YOU HAVE TO KINDA CALL A NEW CLASS AND THEN IT WILL DO IT FINE
IT IT'S A BIT DUMB IF YOU CAN FOOL IT IF YOU C IF YOU C LOAD UP TEN DIFFERENT SI ENGINES SIMULTANEOUSLY
IT CAN DO THAT FINE
BUT IF YOU DON'T THEN IT WON'T L YEAH IT SAYS OKAY OH YEAH I'VE GOT ALL THIS SPACE YOU CAN USE SOME
BUT IT CAN'T DO THEM IT CAN'T DO THEM IF IT THINKS ONE
OTHERWISE IT GOES OH NO
SAY NICE MACHINE IT GOES
IT TALKS TO ME YEAH
YEAH I THINK PROBABLY YEAH
THAT'S A
ARE YOU SERIOUS
REALLY
REALLY
'KAY
YEAH OKAY
THAT'S INSANE
MORE MEMORY
MM
OH YEAH ALLOCATES MORE DAT MORE ROOM OR WHATEVER
SO I CAN FEEL THAT IN NOW
THE WINDOWS ARE ALL THERE NOW AFTER LOTS OF FIDDLING
DOES IT TALK TO YOU NOW DOES IT
YEAH
SPENT TOO MUCH TIME IN FRONT OF IT I THINK
RIGHT WELL I'VE BEEN UH I'VE BEEN DOING SOME RANDOM POP UP WINDOWS FOR THE SPEAKER CHARACTERISATION WHICH IS GOOD
OKAY
RIGHT OKAY
OKAY
OH YEAH
OKAY COOL
OH THEY'RE DONE ARE THEY
I MEAN DO WE WANT SOME GENERAL BLURB ABOUT WELCOME TO THE BROWSER OR SOMETHING
WELL YOU KNOW JUST THE POP UH POP UP WINDOW WAS DIFFICULT ENOUGH
BECAUSE UM IT IT M BASICALLY HAS TO SET UP UM LIKE WHATEVER TEN POP UP WINDOWS IN MEMORY AS IN ALREADY INITIALIZE THEM
WHAT KIND OF START SCREEN DO WE WANT
AND I HAVE UH A QUESTION ABOUT THE WE SAID WE WANTED A START SCREEN
SOME ANIMATION DANCING ON
BECAUSE THERE'S THERE MIGHT BE TEN SPEAKERS THAT ALL HAVE TO HAVE DIFFERENT MEE WINDOWS AND UM AND I'M WORKING ON WHEN YOU CLICK ON A TOPIC TO SEE A LIST OF THE OF THE TOPICS OF OF OF THE MEETINGS THAT THAT TOPIC WAS MENTIONED IN
THEY POP UP
UH YEAH
OH
OKAY
OKAY
HMM
YEAH
SOME SOME SOME SPEECH AND SOME MUSIC SOME DRUM ROLLS
WELCOME TO THE L. S. N. L. S. D. BROWSER
YEAH
YEAH
OR JUST OR IS IT MORE LIKE RIGHT
YEAH
OH RIGHT YEAH EXACTLY
IT DOESN'T TAKE TOO LONG NO
UM BUT NO OR SOMETHING THAT JUST SORT OF GUIDES THEM TO THE MOST OBVIOUS THINGS
JUST WE HAVE TO YEAH WHILE WE'RE DEBUGGING WE'LL PROBABLY BE GETTING SICK OF IT
SO DO WE WANT YEAH MAYBE WE COULD WRITE AN ON LIKE THE WHATEVER IT'S CALLED THE THE TOP OF THE WINDOW SAYING WELCOME TO THE MEETING BROWSER
YEAH
RIGHT
HMM
OR A SWITCH BOARD THAT COMES UP THAT'S JUST A BLANK FORM LIKE THAT WITH SOME BUTTONS ON
YEAH
LOAD ME A MEETING LOAD ME A SEARCH LOAD ME SOMETHING ELSE
WHISTLE A TUNE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH BUT HOW
UM WITH ALL THE AND THAT BECAUSE IT'S IT'S THE DIALOGUE CLASS THAT YOU USE THERE
M I MEAN AT THE MOMENT THE WAY IT IS IT'S UH IT'S A DROP DOWN MENU AS YOU'VE SEEN
YEAH RIGHT
YEAH
MM SHOULD MM
I WAS JUST GONNA ASK IF WE SHOULD ASSUME THAT THEY ALL WANNA LOAD A MEETING FIRST BUT NOT NECESSARILY
YEAH
I GUESS IF THEY'RE DOING A SEARCH ON THE ENTIRE YEAH CORPUS
YEAH
I MEAN I THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE TWO OPTIONS EITHER LOAD UP A MEETING THAT THEY CHOOSE OR DO A SEARCH
AND THROUGH THAT ONCE YOU'VE GOT THE RESULTS YOU CLICK ON SOMETHING AND THAT LOADS UP THE FIRST
YEAH THAT KINDA MAKES SENSE
I THAT'S CHEAPER THAN X. T. SEARCH
IT WOULD NEED YOU TO HAVE A MEETING LOADED BEFORE IT WILL START DOING ANY SEARCHING AT ALL DOESN'T IT
HMM
WELL WE CAN PUT THE LOGIC IN A YEAH
RIGHT
DOES IT
OH
OH
YOU CAN'T THE THE ONLY THING YOU CAN SEARCH IS A NITE OBJECT MODEL AND THE ONLY TIME YOU GET ONE OF THOSE IF YOU'VE LOADED AN OBSERVATION
OH JU JUST BEC MM
I COULD PROBABLY EVEN THAT S SHOULDN'T BE TOO HARD TO PUT A CHECK IN THERE
AND IF IT HASN'T LOADED THEN FORCE HIM TO LOAD ONE
OH
BUT YOU WON'T
WHICH WE BUT DOESN'T THAT WAY C YOU COU YOU COULD USE THE INVERTED FILE SEARCH TO RETURN A LIST OF OF MEETINGS AND THEN USE ONE OF THOSE TO LOAD A SEARCH
YEAH
MM-HMM
CAN YOU NOT GET THIS NOM OBJECT UM
BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE IT HAS TO START WITH SOMETHING FOR SOME BIZARRE REASON
UH THE ENGINE CLASS ONLY HAS ONE SEARCH METHOD
THE ENGINE THERE'S ONLY ONE THERE'S ONLY ONE SEARCH METHOD TO THE SEARCH ENGINE
IT HAS TO BE AN OBSERVATION AND EVEN IF YOU GO AND SE YOU CAN GO AND SEARCH THE WHOLE CORPUS FROM THAT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
SO D SO LET'S SAY
I SUPPOSE WE WOULDN'T WANNA USE YEAH WE YEAH WE WOULDN'T WANNA USE N. X. T. AT THE BEGINNING ANYWAY
BECAUSE WE DON'T WANNA SEARCH UM LOCALLY WE WANNA SEARCH GLOBALLY
YEAH YEAH GLOBALLY YEAH
UNLESS THEY KNOW WHAT MEETING IT IS
WELL YEAH IT'S HARD TO
YEAH
WELL NO THEN THEY WOULD OPEN THE MEETING FIRST RIGHT
SO LET'S SAY THEY HAVE TWO OPTIONS EITHER PICK ONE MEETING OR SEARCH GLOBALLY TO FIND A MEETING THAT THEY LIKE
YEAH
YEAH
YEP
OR WELL THE THINGS THEY MAY N JUST BE LOOKING FOR A WORD OR WHATE YOU KNOW LIKE AND IF IT SHOWS UP TEN DIFFERENT MEETINGS
YEAH
I MEAN THEN THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE
THEN AT THAT POINT THEY'LL PROBABLY WANNA LIKE WE DO WE WANT TO LIKE IF IT DUMPED BY DEFAULT GOES WITH THE FIRST ONE AND THEY WANT NUMBER FIVE OF THE ONES THAT ARE RETURNED
YEAH
I MEAN JUST YOU KNOW
NO BUT WHY DO WE WANT DEFAULT
WELL NO T LIKE TO LOAD UP LIKE THE THING IS THAT I THINK
THAT'S TRUE YEAH
RIGHT NOW I THINK JUST THE TOPIC ONES
OKAY RIGHT YEAH
I MEAN BEFORE YOU DO A SEARCH AT ALL ON THIS
SO I'M JUST THINKING IF IT'S KINDA LIKE YOU WERE SAYING YOU HAVE TO HAVE A NOM OBJECT RIGHT
UM ALTHOUGH THE TIME IS PROBABLY MORE UM CAUSED BY LOADING THE ACTUAL DATA
UH LIKE WHEN IT LOADS UP IT'LL LOAD UP THE TRANSCRIPT WINDOW AND THE WHATEVER OTHER WINDOW
YEAH
YEAH BUT LOCAL SEARCH
WE CAN'T DO GLOBAL SEARCH WITHOUT ANYTHING
PRETTY MUCH
IT DOESN'T TAKE LONG TO LOAD UP ANYWAY
YOU CAN LOAD A DUMB ONE UP THAT DOESN'T HAVE ANY
YEAH BUT THE OKAY THE GLOBAL ONE FEEDS INTO THE LOCAL
UM SO IF WE'RE GETTING ANY USABLE DATA IT'S IT'S GONNA BE DOING A SEARCH ON EACH OF THOSE FILES
SO IT'S GONNA BE LOADING UP EACH OF THOSE ONE AT A TIME TO GET THE DATA THAT WE WANNA
YEAH I MEAN THE LOCAL
YEAH
BUT YEAH THE THE GLOBAL UM INVERTED FILE SEARCH GIVES THE NOM OBJECTS BASICALLY TO THE LOCAL SEARCH RIGHT
EXACTLY YEAH
RIGHT
BUT IT'S IT COULD BE TIME CONSUMING LIKE IF THERE ARE TEN DOCUMENTS THAT HIT WITH THIS THING THEN
WELL YEAH TH THAT'S ALWAYS GONNA BE THE CASE WITH SEARCH
BUT ONLY GIVES ONE AT A TIME ANYWAY DOESN'T IT
YEAH
'CAUSE OTHERWISE YOU'LL CRASH THE THING
OH
TEN DIFFERENT MEETINGS YOU KNOW WITH THE WORD WIRELESS COMES UP
NEXT ONE
IF UH IF IT'S TRYING TO SHOW US WHERE THOSE WERE IF IT'S TRYING TO HIGHLIGHT THOSE IN THE TEXT TRANSCRIPT OR WHATEVER
OKAY RIGHT
ST CASH THE RESULTS AND IN A NICE LITTLE FORMAT THAT'LL MAKE THINGS A BIT EASIER
I MEAN THAT'S GONNA THAT COULD BE YEAH
BUT THE THING IS I MEAN IF WE'VE GOT THAT THEN IT'S GONNA BE NEEDING REALLY REALLY TO LOAD THE ENTIRE CORPUS FOR THAT MEETING
AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO HAVE ALL THAT OTHER DATA IN THERE
SO EACH TIME WHEN WE HAVE A SHE SEARCH WINDOW AND WE HAVE LIKE YOU KNOW
GO TO MEETING ONE THEN IT HAS TO RELOAD THE NOM OBJECT
UM YEAH WELL I'M J JUST THINKING OF SOME WAY WE COULD YOU KNOW
IT'S NOT TOO SLOW THOUGH THAT THING
I DON'T THINK THAT WILL BE A MUCH OF A PROBLEM
YEAH
IT SHOULDN'T IT'S NOT IT'S NOT TOO BAD ON THAT
TEST IT TRY SOMETHING ELSE AND THEN SHUT DOWN LOAD IT UP
BUT UH IF IT DOESN'T TAKE THAT LONG EACH TIME THEN THAT SHOULD BE F ALRIGHT
BUT SO UM SO JUST SORTA BASED ON THAT AS A YEAH
IT ALWAYS SEEMS TO BE SLOW LOADING UP THE FIRST TIME AT LEAST LIKE THAT'S ALL I I'VE BEEN DOING LATELY IS JUST SORT OF LOADING IT UP
YEAH YEAH
MM
YEAH
FIRST AS A FIRST STEP AND YOU RETURN THE MEETINGS
AS IN THEY'RE NOT EVEN THE MEETINGS BUT THE NAME OF THE MEETINGS SO YOU KNOW SAY YOU WANNA SEARCH FOR THE WORD LANGUAGE
THEN IT GIVES YOU AS A RESULT ALL THE MEETINGS THAT CONTAIN THE WORD LANGUAGE
I MEAN YOU CAN UH YOU KNOW THE OPTION IS TO DO A SEARCH IN THE WAY THAT YOU D IF YOU DO A GLOBAL SEARCH
AND THEN YOU CAN DECIDE WELL I WANNA SEARCH ON THIS AND THIS AND THIS MEETING OR ONLY ON THIS MEETING OR
HMM
YEAH RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
THAT'S TRUE
MA MAKE IT STRINGS FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE AND THEN ONLY RETURN THE THINGS WHEN THEY ACTUALLY NEEDS TO HAS TO SEARCH
YEAH YEAH
WHEN IT NEEDS TO BE LOADED
THAT
YEAH
YEAH
SO
YEAH THAT MAKES SENSE
SO YEAH OR THEY COULD CHECK MARK AGAINST THE ONES THEY WANNA CHECK
AND THAT WAY IF THEY KNOW SPECIFICALLY WHICH MEANING IT IS THEN THAT'LL SAVE THE TIME
BECAUSE I'M SURE THEY DON'T WANNA HAVE THE EXTRA LOADING TIME EITHER IF THEY COULD AVOID IT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
DEFINITELY YEAH
YEAH
DID WE THINK ABOUT UM
BETTER NAMES FOR THE MEETINGS
WE CAN PROBABLY DO THAT OURSELVES AND JUST SORT OF B. D. B. YOU KNOW JUST DO A A STRING
WELL I THINK THEY WERE IN THE TEXT
I I LOVE THAT
THERE IS UM YEAH IN THE IN IN ONE OF THE PAPERS THEY HAVE M UM NAMES SUCH AS UM BETTER UNDERSTANDING OR WHATEVER
YEAH
EVEN W ONE OF THEM IS YEAH ONE OF THEM IS EVEN EVEN BETTER UNDERSTANDING OR SOMETHING
I LOVE THAT
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
THAT PROBABLY EVEN MIGHT HAVE A
LIKE THE THE WORKING GROUP THAT IT'S PART OF
YEAH THE LONG NAMES
OH DO THEY DO THEY RE TRANSLATE THEM
OKAY WELL THAT'S ALRIGHT THEN
WE'LL JUST USE THAT THEN
DO THEY
YEAH
I WANNA SEE THE MEETINGS ABOUT EVEN BETTER UNDERSTANDING
OKAY
WELL THAT'S WHAT'S THE THAT'S THE WORKING GROUP IS IT
YEAH RIGHT
YEAH
YEP
SEE IF IT'S ACCURATE
SO I'VE YEAH I'VE PUT THAT IN ALREADY TO
OKAY THAT'S COOL THAT'S GOOD
SORT OF
SO YEAH AGAIN CONCRETELY TO THE START UP START UP UM LIBRARIES WINDOW
UM
SO WHO WOULD THE THE UM I. D. F. S
THE DOCUMENT FREQUENCIES FOR EACH WORD IN THE CORPUS
I MEAN THE D. F. S
WELL CAN I
UM DO WE ACTUALLY NEED THE UH THE FREQUENCIES
YEAH TO DO UM WHAT STEVE'S TALKING ABOUT YOU DO
TO DO THE TOPIC LABELLING
YEAH
RIGHT
YEAH OKAY
YEAH
OH RIGHT THAT
I MEAN DO YOU THINK YOU WOULD HAVE HAVE TIME FOR THAT AS WELL
YEAH HOW IS THAT
WELL THING IS IF IT'S BEING DONE THERE WERE THERE WAS
IF SOMEBODY'S DONE THE KEYWORDS OR THE THE G I. D. F. S OR THE D. F. S ALREADY WOULD
UM THEY DID HAVE ALL THAT AND IT WAS SORTA BUILT IN AND JUST UH HAD SOME TROUBLE GETTING IT RUNNING PROPERLY
SO SHE WAS GONNA LOOK AT YOU KNOW MORE STRAIGHT FORWARD SORTA THING THAT REALLY JUST FULFILS WHAT WE NEED IT TO DO
THERE'S A @'S TRYING TO GET UH TO WORK ON FRIDAY
UM BUT IT HAD SORT OF ALL THAT STANDARD SORT OF STUFF BUT IT W IT LAST I HEARD IT WASN'T WORKING
YEAH
BUT IF WE NEED THE IF WE DO NEED THE FREQUENCIES THEN
CAN'T YOU DO ANY BETTER FOR OUR SEARCH WITHOUT THE T. F. I. D. F.
UM I DON'T KNOW
SO IF YOU SO THE MORE IT OCCURS IN SPECIFIC DOCUMENTS COMPARED COMPARED TO ITS GENERAL SCORE THE BET MORE INFORMATIVE IT IS ABOUT A CERTAIN
I THINK YOU NEED TO
TERM FREQUENCY IS THE AMOUNT THAT THAT IT OCCURS IN EA ONE OF THEM IS THE AMOUNT IT OCCURS IN EACH DOCUMENT AND THE OTHER ONE IS THE AMOUNT IT G OCCURS GENERALLY
BASICALLY THE AMOUNT THEY D. F. IS THE DOCUMENT FREQUENCY IS THE AMOUNT THAT EACH WORD OCCURS UM NO WHAT IS IT
IT'S THE AMOUNT THAT THEY OCCUR OVER DOCUMENTS
UM WELL IT WAS WOULD'VE BEEN LIKE A LIST OF
WHA WHAT DOES T. F. I. D. F. STAND FOR
WHAT'S IT STAND FOR
HMM
OH
OKAY
MM
YEAH
AH
WELL YOU KNOW YOU CAN YOU MIGHT HAVE SOME GENERAL FREQUENCIES
SO THE GENERAL SCORE WOULD THAT BE A UM FOR THE WHOLE OF THE LANGUAGE OR THE FOR ALL THE WHOLE OF THE CORPUS
OKAY
OKAY
THE CORPUS THE CORPUS STILL DATA
NO
YEAH
YEAH
BUT PLUS A STOP LIST SO YOU REMOVE STUFF THAT DOESN'T TA IT LIKE YEAH AND THEN THE WHICH IS GONNA A A PROB BASICALLY EQUAL SCORE
YEAH
WELL THE CORPUS YEAH
SO YEAH THE PROBABLY PROBABLY TERM FREQUENCY
YEAH SO THE GENERAL ONE IS PR YEAH YEAH
OH I SEE
RIGHT
A BUNCH
SO WHAT WOULD THE IF WE HAD THE THESE FAKE TOPICS WHAT WHAT WOULD THE WHAT WOULD THEY LOOK LIKE
JUST A LIST OF LIKE THREE WORDS OR SOMETHING
OR A MASSIVE
YEAH KEY WORDS THREE F THREE FIVE WORDS
BUNCH OF KEY WORDS
THAT'D PROBABLY BE EASIEST THING
KEY WORDS
YEAH TERM FREQUENCY INVERSE DOCUMENT FREQUENCY
IN BOTH DOCUMENTS
OKAY
REALLY
ACTUALLY WHAT'S THE I. IN T. F. I. D. F.
I DID DO IT ONCE I DO HAVE A JAVA CLASS THAT DOES IT FOR SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT'LL WORK WITH THIS
BUT
OH YEAH
BUT WE CAN'T WE CAN'T COMPARE IT TO THE TO THE UH HAND ANNOTATED YOU KNOW THE HAND SEGMENTED TOOL
'CAUSE IF YOU JUST HAVE THE SEGMENTATION THAT'S GREAT
BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE REALLY HANDY THEN WE CAN ACTUALLY TEST IT ON THE USER AS OPPOSED TO JUST DOING IT AND NOT USING IT
ALRIGHT
ALRIGHT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
INSTEAD UH IT WOULD JUST SEARCH FOR KEY WORDS WHEN IT WHEN THEY YOU TELL HIM THAT WITH TOPICS BUT ACTUALLY GET SEARCHING WITH KEY WORDS
YOU DO KEYWORD SEARCH
BUT YOU COULD DO KEY WORD SEARCH COULD BE TOPIC SEARCH CAN THEY CAN BE THE SAME THING
ALSO KEY WORDS GIVES YOU A A WHOLE NEW TYPE OF SEARCH
UH-HUH
FOR EACH DO YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN
HMM
MM
HMM
THAT'D BE REALLY NICE
YEAH THAT WOULD WORK
BUT I SUPPOSE EVEN CALCULATING THE THE W THE THE WHAT'S ITS FACES THEMSELVES WOULD BE TOO MUCH TOO LONG
'CAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE TO INTEGRATE AS MUCH INFORMATION
THE EASY BIT IS IT'S PROBABLY THE EASIEST TO CALCULATE THEM BASED UPON IN THEIR WHOLE OCCURRENCES IN I IN THE CORPUS THAN IT IS TO CALCULATE THEM PER TOPIC
MM YEAH YEAH DEFINITELY
RIGHT
NO YOU CAN DO YOU CAN DO SEARCH WITHOUT T. F. I. D. F. YOU JUST CAN'T RANK THE SEARCH
OH YEAH
I MEAN WE'RE JUST LOOKING OH FOR FOR YOUR S FOR YOUR STUFF I GUESS YEAH
FOR TOPIC WITH
WELL DO WE NEED TO
WELL DO WE WANT TO
YEAH THAT'S WHAT I'M THINKING TOO YEAH
DO WE WANT TO
YEAH
NO NO NO BUT THAT'S WHAT ISN'T THAT WHAT THE IDEA WAS IN THE FIRST PLACE TO RANK THESE RANK THE RESULTS SO THAT
BUT IT WOULD BE
SORT OF BUT THEN THE MAIN IDEA WAS MORE LIKE TO TO SPEED IT UP SPEED THE SEARCH UP
BECAUSE N. X. T. OVER THE OVER THE WHOLE OF THE CORPUS WAS JUST NOT FEASIBLE
UM
YEAH
YEAH BUT THAT WON'T SLOW IT DOWN
RANKING IT WON'T SLOW IT DOWN
YEAH
OH YEAH
NO BUT THE GENERAL INVERTED FILE
THAT WOULD JUST BE A NICE EXTRA
YEAH YEAH YEAH
IT STILL USES AN INVERTED FILE BUT IT RANKS THE RESULTS BY THE AMOUNT BY THE HIGHER YEAH
I THOUGHT THAT WAS PART OF IT BUT YEAH OKAY IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S NOT
YEAH
SO WHAT IT'S ONLY INTERIM
YEAH I I WASN'T SURE IF IT WAS OR NOT
IT'S TRUE
TRUE
I DON'T THINK WE HAD THAT IN THE THE DOCUMENT
I KNOW
HMM
YEAH
YEAH EXACTLY
UM
NO WE DID YEAH
BUT YEAH I GUESS UH IF YOU DO IF IF THAT'S NOT PART OF IT DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT IT DOESN'T
HMM
MM-HMM
RIGHT
RIGHT
YEAH B NICE TO HAVE
YEAH I MEAN IF YOU HAVE TIME
THAT WOULD BE SO USEFUL
DO THAT AS WELL THAT'D BE REALLY NICE YEAH
YEAH EXACTLY
IT WOULD GIVE YOU THE THE MEETINGS BUT ALSO HOW OFTEN THE W THAT WORD OCCURRED IN THAT MEETING
YEAH
'CAUSE I MEAN THEN THEN IT WOULD GIVE YOU LIKE IF YOU SEARCHED FOR A WORD
SO
'CAUSE I'M ONLY GONNA DO THIS IF I'VE GOT TIME ANYWAY
WELL IT'D JUST GIVE YOU A RANK
IT WOULD THAT WAS THE WHOLE POINT WAS TO IF YOU SAY THIS IS YOUR TOP ONE THIS IS YOUR BOTTOM
YEAH
MM
WELL I DON'T KNOW
THEY JUST WANNA KNOW IF THAT TERM EXISTS THERE AND WHERE DOES IT EXIST AND I WANNA SEE IT YOU KNOW
ACTUALLY 'CAUSE THE THING IS I MEAN TYPICALLY YEAH
BUT TH UM THE THING IS WE'RE JUST LOOKING FOR WHEN IT HAPPENS IN A MEETING IF THEY'RE LOOKING FOR PARTICULAR TERM OR SOMETHING
YEAH YEAH
BUT SAY BUT IT'S HOW HOW INFORMATIVE
SO
THAT T. F. I. D. F. IS AN INFORMATIVE SCORE ISN'T IT
YEAH
BASICALLY ALL OF THE MEETINGS YOU WANNA SEE WHERE THEY ACTUALLY SPOKE ABOUT IT AND WHERE THEY JUST MENTIONED IT ONCE
YOU KNOW YOU C IF YOU HAVE A IF IF YOU SEARCH FOR LANGUAGE AND YOU RETURN LIKE YOU KNOW
YEAH BUT IT WOULD BE USEFUL IF YOU YEAH
YEAH
'KAY
BUT IF IT'S LIKE A TWO WORD TERM DOES THE T. F. I. D. F. HANDLE THAT
JUST SOMETHING LIKE UH EDINBURGH UNIVERSITY
IT'S NOT A COMPOUND NOUN IT'S JUST TWO WORDS TOGETHER
UM IN F I DON'T KNOW
YEAH
I DON'T KNOW
WELL ESSENTIALLY I DON'T KNOW
OR SUNNY DAY
YOU KNOW
DEPENDS HOW YOU TREAT YOUR COMPOUND NOUNS
AH
LIKE WHAT
LANGUAGE AND
UM
AS A COMPOUND NOUN
AND LIKE AN ADJECTIVE YEAH
UH SUNNY DAY YEAH
NO JUST LIKE EDINBURGH AND LANGUAGE
ALRIGHT
IN ITS MOST SIMPLE FORM IT WOULD DO A SEPARATE RANK FOR EACH ONE EACH TERM
YOU COULD MAKE IT MORE COMPLICATED AND MAKE IT DO FOR TH FOR THE YEAH
HMM
AND THEN IF IT WAS THEN WE GO CLOSER AND DO THE THE N. X. T. SEARCH UH TO LOOK FOR THE EXACT TERM OR THE REGULAR EXPRESSION OR WHATEVER
YEAH
WELL THAT'S WAY WE WERE THINKING ABOUT IT
AND THEN THEN IT'S JUST SAYING WERE THESE TWO WORDS IN IN ANY OF THESE DOCUMENTS
LET'S NOT MAKE IT MORE COMPLICATED
PERIOD EACH WORD IN THE UM IN THE INDEX
BECAUSE THE THING IS THE THING IS THAT THE WAY WE WERE DOING IT WE WERE JUST LOOKING FOR THE WORDS
AND THEN AND THEN AD ADD THOSE UP OR SOMETHING
OR WHAT
HOW WOULD YOU COMBINE THEM THAT'S THE QUESTION
YOU CAN JUST ADD 'EM UP OR YOU CAN
YEAH
YEAH YOU DON'T WANNA START LOOKING FOR BO
YEAH YEAH
UM
YEAH
AND THE HIGHER THE MORE UH MORE INFORMATIVE EACH TERM IS FOR EACH THING WOULD GIVE YOU A
I GUESS YOU JUST DO A SUM OF THE UM OF THE THE INDIVIDUAL T. F. I. D. F. FOR EACH TERM RETURNED
AND THAT GENERALLY WILL BE A BIT CRUDE BUT IT WILL GIVE YOU A D SCORE
YEAH
RIGHT
IT'S PRETTY CRUDE ANYWAY BUT IT'S JUST LOOKING FOR UM
A THING
SO YEAH THAT'S LESS CRUDE ISN'T IT
BUT UM
YEAH YEAH THAT'S TRUE
IF IT'S ALL IT'S GONNA DO IS LOOK FOR SIX SEPARATE C OH 'CAUSE THEN IT'S GONNA GO INTO THE N. X. T. SEARCH AND RETURN THAT ISN'T IT
SO MM YEAH
YEAH
SO YEAH
OR WE CHOOSE THE LIST OF MEETINGS THAT WE WANTED TO SEARCH TO DO THAT
UM
LIKE I'M JUST WONDERING IF IF IT'S GONNA GIVE US SOMETHING COOL THEN YEAH ABSOLUTELY
BUT IF IT'S SORT LIKE IF THE N. X. T. SEARCH HAS STILL GOTTA BE RUN TO FIND THESE TERMS OR THESE YOU KNOW THESE PATTERNS THEN UH
YEAH WITHOUT DOING ANY LIKE UM WORD PAIRS WHICH IS JUST OMISSION
GROUPS OF TERMS
OR ALSO LIKE DO UM WILD CARDS WORK FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
SO OR PERNILLA
NOT Y ACTUALLY THAT'S A PROBLEM FOR ME TOO
AND UH
SO IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR WIRELESS WIRED WIRE BLAH BLAH BLAH YOU DO WIRE WITH A STAR AND UM NO
BUT THEN THE IDEA IS THAT GIVES YOU AN INFORMATIVE SCORE
YEAH
HOW YOU COMBINE THAT IS IS UP TO YOU
THEY'VE GOT A BIG A GOOD CHAPTER ON IT
YEAH
BASIC INFORMATION RETRIEVAL
IF YOU HAVEN'T GOT IT IT'S ON COGNATE
YEAH I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT WORKS
THAT'S HOW I REMEM YEAH
I IF S IF YOU WERE IS THERE'S A LO WHOLE LOAD ABOUT IT IN MANNING AND SCHUTZ
I GUESS IT THERE'S LOTS IN THE LITERATURE
SO THEY'VE GOT A WHOLE CHUNK ABOUT IT'S SO JUST I. R. ISN'T THIS
YEAH 'CAUSE
ACTUALLY IT SHOULD WORK YEAH
OKAY THEN I'M JUST YEAH
SURE THAT'S NOT TOO BAD
OH YEAH
OH YEAH
OKAY
YEAH I'VE GOT UH SOMEWHERE P. D. F.
YEAH
ME TOO
HUNDREDS OF P. D. F. S
YEAH WHAT IF IT'S YEAH
DO THE P. D. F. S SWITCH IT TO POSTSCRIPT SWITCH IT BACK TO P. D. F. AND THEN
YEAH
DON'T KNOW
OKAY SO THAT'S OKAY THAT MIGHT BE GOOD
OKAY
ALRIGHT
I MEAN WE WANNA FOR THE PART WHERE YOU CAN CHOOSE CHOOSE THE THE MEETING WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION DO YOU WANNA HAVE ABOUT THE MEETING
I MEAN THE U THE THE LONGER NAME OBVIOUSLY IF THERE IS ONE 'CAUSE THEY DON'T ALL HAVE A LONGER NAME
THE USERS THAT TOOK PART
BUT THEN THAT'S PROBABLY PRETTY MUCH THE SAME FOR THE SAME GROUP
WHAT THE USERS THAT SPOKE
SO TO COME BACK TO THE START UP SCREEN I'M I'M I'M I'M VERY UNSURE ABOUT WHAT THAT SHOULD LOOK LIKE
OH I THOUGHT WE SORT OF DIS YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
OKAY
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
OR ATTENDED YEAH
P PROBABLY FOR THE MOST PART I MEAN THERE'LL BE A SET OF PEOPLE THAT DO AND THEN A SUB SET FOR EACH MEETING PROBABLY
YEAH I'M NOT SURE
DO YOU WANT THAT ON THE START UP SCREEN YEAH
'CAUSE
YEAH JUST TO GIVE THEM AN IDEA GENERAL IDEA WHAT THERE IS AND SO THEY CAN PICK A A TO UM A MEETING
OR OR BROWSE OKAY LIKE SEARCH BROWSE UM
SEARCH FOR STUFF OR START WORKING OR NO
YEAH I GUESS SO
YEAH YEAH I GUESS THAT'S USEFUL
LIKE IF THEY IF THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THEY WANNA GO THEY WANNA GO TO YOU KNOW THAT MEETING ON DECEMBER THIRD
UM
AND THEY JUST WANNA GO THERE AND SEE STUFF THEN THEY CAN IMMEDIATELY GO AND BROWSE THAT
LIKE IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING SPECI LIKE IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE THINKING
YEAH
I WANT THAT FIRST MEETING
LOOK AT THAT
YEAH OR W YOU KN YEAH
I WANNA LOOK AT THE MEETING WHERE SO AND SO SPOKE UM OF THAT YOU KNOW SORT OF SOME SORT OF RESEARCH GROUP
YEAH
RIGHT
YEAH
I MEAN WE JUST UH WE COULD BREAK THINGS DOWN LIKE THAT TO THAT LEVEL OF DETAIL IF WE WANT
YEAH
OR WE COULD KEEP A MORE GENERAL
LIKE DID NO I'M JUST THINKING OF DIFFERENT WAYS WE CAN DO THAT LIKE DIFFERENT BUTTONS ON THE TOP
YEAH
BROWSE BY MEETING BROWSE BY BLAH BROWSE BY SPEAKER
LIKE IF THEY'RE LOOKING FOR PARTICULAR PERSON PARTICULAR WORKING GROUP PARTICULAR WHATEVER
OH
OH
BECAUSE AS SOON AS THEY'VE GOT LOADED THEIR FIRST MEETING Y THEY CAN THEY CAN BROWSE THROUGH THAT QUITE NICELY
MM I DON'T THINK WE NEED THAT YEAH
BECAUSE WE WE JUST WANNA HAVE A WAY OF OF YEAH
WHAT ARE THE RANGE OF THINGS THAT THEY'D WANNA DO
LIKE IF THEY'RE PART OF X. WORKING GROUP THEY'LL WANNA GET IN THERE
UM DO WE WANNA SAVE PREFERENCES
UM YEAH BUT I'M JUST THINKING LIKE INITIALLY WHEN THEY LOAD UP
YEAH
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
OR DON'T KNOW
WELL IF THEY'RE PART OF B. D. B. WORKING GROUP THEY'RE GONNA WANNA LOOK AT THE B. D. B. ONES AND SO WE'D DEFAULT TO THAT
W HOW HOW ARE WE GONNA KNOW THAT
BASED ON WHAT THEY DID THE LAST TIME
YEAH
HAVE A USER MODEL
YOU COULD HAVE A SAVE PREFERENC PREFERENCES I GUESS
UH YOU CAN HAVE A SAVE PREFERENCES
MM-HMM
LET'S SEE WHAT'S CHANGED TODAY
WELL YOU JUST YOU JUST UH YOU JUST SCROLL DOWN THE LIST AND FIND YOUR FAVOURITE ONE
I MEAN IT'S NOT LIKE THEY COME BACK EVERY DAY AND DO THE SAME BROWSING
BUT THAT WOULD DEFY THE WHOLE POINT OF BROWSING RIGHT
MM
IF YOU ONLY WANTED TO LOOK AT LIKE FIVE MEETINGS
YEAH OKAY RIGHT
YEAH OKAY YEAH THAT'S YEAH
YEAH
RIGHT
MM
YOU CAN HAVE A FAVOURITES
WELL ALRIGHT CALL IT FAVOURITES THEN
YEAH IT'S NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION IS IT TO
AND JUST LIKE HEY MY TASK IS TO DO THIS AND THERE'S A BUTTON FOR IT
THEN DO THIS BLAH BLAH BLAH
YEAH EXACTLY
YOU KNOW
I MEAN JUST I DON'T KNOW JUST PLAYING AROUND WITH IDEAS
YOU KNOW
WHAT WAS THAT
WELL NO I'M JUST GETTING BACK TO SORTA WHAT COULD BE ON THE THE START UP SCREEN
SO WE CAN YEAH SORT OF UM YOU KNOW GUIDE THEM
I FORGET
RIGHT
UM OKAY
I DON'T KNOW
UM AND THEN WE CAN TIE THIS INTO OUR EVALUATION UH TASKS AND SAY WELL IF YOU WANT TO SEARCH FOR A MEETING OR SEARCH FOR A USER IN A PARTICULAR MEETING
LIKE THERE IS JUST A RANGE OF THINGS WE COULD DO WE COULD HAVE LIKE SEARCH OPTIONS BROWSE OPTIONS
OH P PERFECT
YEAH YEAH
YEAH YEP
OH RIGHT OH OKAY
WELL
NO THAT'S UM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH IT WOULD BE QUITE GOOD IF IT HAS YEAH
I W I WASN'T GONNA PUT ANY YOU KNOW ANY ANY HELP IN THERE ANY SORT OF A EXPLANATION OF HOW THE BROWSER WORKS TO BE HONEST
I WASN'T OH RIGHT
YOU KNOW AS WELL
NO I'M JUST SAYING LIKE THESE ARE JUST LIKE A LOT OF PROGRAMMES WELL KIND OF LAME PROGRAMMES DO HAVE THAT SORT OF THING FIRST
NO NO THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M SUGGESTING
JUST 'CAUSE THEY DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH ALL THE MENUS AND SEARCH THEMSELVES AND JUST LIKE DO COMMONLY USED TASKS OR JUST EXIT AND JUST LET ME USE THE PROGRAMME
SO
JUST A B SEARCH BUTTONS SO JUST
I SEE
MM-HMM
MM
YEAH YEAH
DOOFUS MODE
BUT I MEAN THE MAIN THING WHAT YOU WANNA DO IS TO VIEW A MEETING RIGHT
YEAH
PROBABLY OR SEARCH SOMETHING
SO IF EVEN IF IT JUST HAD TWO THINGS
YEAH
AND THEN ANOTHER THAT SAID SEARCH THAT LOADED INSTANTLY
IT LOADED UP THE SEARCH SCREEN
OR SEARCH YEAH YEAH
JUST SAID ONE SAI ONE SAID TAKE ME STRAIGHT TO THIS MEETING AND HAVE A M TEXT BOX YOU CAN ENTER IT OR A DROP DOWN MENU
YEAH YEAH OR ONE THAT YEAH OR ONE THAT
S AND BOTH OF THOSE WE HAVE AND
YEAH OR SEARCH YEAH
YOU KNOW THAT'S AN EASY SORT OF THING AND
MM
YEAH LIKE FIND SPECIFIC MEETING
OR HE DOESN'T AND THEN HE SEARCHES FOR ONE THAT SORT OF LOOKS LIKE
BASICALLY EITHER THE USER WA KNOWS WHICH MEETING HE WANTS TO LOOK AT AND HE JUST CLICKS ON IT
YEAH THAT UH ALL HAPPENS FOR THE SEARCH BASICALLY
YEAH
FITS HIS CRITERIA
MM-HMM
OR THE OTHER THING TO DO IS JUST HAVE SEARCH AS THE DEFAULT
YEAH
JUST IT OPENS AND THE SEARCH WINDOW OPENS
AND THAT'S THE INTERFACE AND YOU JUST GO FROM THERE
YEAH
OR OR THE SEARCH BUT THE SEARCH WINDOW COULD HAVE ON IT SOMETHING THAT SAID JUST HAS A DROP DOWN MENU THAT SAYS JUST AND A GO BUTTON THAT SAID TAKE ME TO THIS
SO THE F ONLY THING THAT COMES UP WHEN YOU'RE FINISHED IS A UM WHEN YOU START IT'S JUST ONE WINDOW LIKE THAT AND IT'S GOT ALL THE SEARCH STUFF LIKE DOWN THERE
AND THEN FROM THERE IT TAKES YOU TO WHEREVER ELSE YOU WANNA GO
AND SO THIS IS YOUR SEARCH
AND SO THE F SO THE IN YEAH
AND THEN THAT BRINGS UP THE BROWSER AFTER YOU F SEARCHED FOR SOMETHING
IT'S JUST ALL HERE AND HERE IS JUST GO TO WHEREVER AND A GO BUTTON
YEAH
OH I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN
INSIDE THE SEARCH MENU YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH THAT'S THAT'S WHAT YEAH
AND THE OTHER TOPIC SAYS WELCOME TO WELCOME TO OUR BROWSER
SO HOW D HOW D
BECAUSE WE NEED DROP DOWN MENU BUT WE WANT ALL THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE NAME THE LONGER NAME AND THE SP AND THE USERS
YEAH THAT LOOKS ABOUT RIGHT
MM-HMM
UM BUT I'M I'M UNSURE ABOUT HOW TO HOW TO PUT ALL THE INFORMATION IN THERE
A DROP DROP DOWN MENU
OH YOU WANNA HAVE OH YEAH THE USERS
AREN'T THERE ALL THESE CODES LIKE AMI ELEVEN OR WHATEVER
WELL WE DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE USER NAMES DO WE
YEAH
THEY'RE ALWAYS NONSENSE YEAH
NO BUT THE CODES I MEAN AT LEAST MAYBE IF THEY KNOW THE CODES AND IN OR THE TO IN OR THE CORPUS CORPI
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
IN A CASE LIKE THAT WE DO WANT DROP DOWN
WE DON'T WANT THEM TO TYPE THEM DO WE
DROP DOWN IS DEFINITELY NOT
YEAH
YEAH IT DOES
UM AND ALLOW MULTIPLE
OKAY
OKAY YOU'RE JUST LOOKING FOR ONE SPECIFIC SPEAKER RIGHT
YEAH
NO
GO ON GO FOR BOTH
IF YOU GO FOR BOTH YOU'RE SEARCHING
ONE ONE IS ONE ONE THERE WHERE YOU GOT TWO ONE FOR MEETING ONE TO SPEAK
THIS IS GOOD BUT IF YOU WANNA SEARCH A SEARCH IF YOU WANNA LOOK FOR ONE MEETING AND JUST LOOK AT IT THEN THAT'S FINE
UM THAT'S THAT'S TRUE THAT'S OR UNLESS YOU HAVE TWO
OR AND YOU CAN CHOOSE YOU CAN GO GO FOR GO OR GO FOR THE OTHER
YEAH
YEP YEP
BUT THEN YEAH AS I SAID HOW DO YOU DO IT
OKAY
ALRIGHT
UM
M
OH FOR SPEAKERS
AND THEN IT GIVES YOU THE LONGER NAME BLAH AND THEN IT GIVES YOU THE YOU KNOW THE PARTICIPANTS
NO NO NO I'M NOT I'M NOT SAYING YOU CAN YOU CAN PICK A USER BUT YOU SHOULD COME UP WITH SOME LIST
BUT AN EXTENDED LIST OF THE OF THE MEETINGS SO YOU KNOW YOU HAVE B. D. R. WHATEVER IT WAS CALLED O. ONE
YEAH
WE COULD DO MICROSOFT STYLIE AND HOLD IT OVER AND IT POPS UP A THING
I'M VERY YEAH VERY KEEN ON THAT YEAH
NO BUT YOU KNOW TO TO SEARCH FOR A U PECIF PEC SPECIFIC USER YOU HAVE TO HOLD YOUR MOUSE OVER THAT ONE
TOOL TIP
YEAH I'M NOT SURE WHAT TH IT IS THAT VERY IS THAT NOT ANNOYING IF YOU HAVE TO HOLD YOUR M YOU KNOW
THEY DO THAT A LOT DON'T THEY
YOU HA YOU HAVE T YEAH Y YES
I WAS THINKING THAT
A TOOL TIP YEAH
YEAH
UH NO IT'S NOT AT ALL I THINK
I'VE NOT TRIED THAT YET BUT I WAS I WAS GONNA DO THAT
BUT THEN YEAH
WAIT FOR IT TO POP UP HOLD YOUR MOUSE ON THAT ONE WAIT FOR THE POP UM
MM-HMM
OH
IS THAT COMPLICATED
MM-HMM
A TOOL TIP
MOUSE OVER ISN'T IT OR SOMETHING
ACTUALLY IN THIS N OH LET'S DO THAT THEN
YOU GET OUT OF THE BLOODY WAY I'M TRYING TO DO A SEARCH THE DAMN THING
YEAH
'CAUSE
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
YEAH
IT'S NOT THE SAME AS DOING A A QUICK ACCESS
MAYBE JUST LEAVE IT JUST HAVE THEM THERE AND DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE SPEAKERS
IF THEY'RE DOING SPEAKERS THEY'RE DOING SEARCH
AND JUST YOU JUST SAY I WANNA LOOK FOR THIS USER
YEAH THAT'S TRUE THAT'S ANNOYING
GO
FIND ME
AND THEN YOU SEARCH THEN BUT THEN YOU DIDN'T SEARCH
FIND ME THEN THEN THEN IT PULLS UP A LIST OF ALL THE ONES WHO GOT THAT USER IN IT
BUT THAT'S WHY YOU COULD JUST HAVE A LIST OF YOUR USERS THEN
HMM
YEAH
MM
YEAH
SO YOU'VE GOT A DROP DOWN MENU A SEARCH A SEARCH BUTTON NOT SEARCH GO BUTTON
YEAH MAYBE THAT'S THE BEST IDEA THEN
IT'D JUST BE NICE TO HAVE SOME BASIC INFORMATION ON ON EACH OF THE MEETINGS
YEAH I'M THINKING THAT THAT UPDATES DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU'VE GOT HIGHLIGHTED
OR YOU CAN HAVE A F TEXT BOX THERE THAT'S GOT YEAH AS YOU GO OVER THEM
YEAH
THEN THAT DOESN'T GET IN YOUR IN THE WAY
YEAH
YEAH JUST SO YEAH
THAT'S LIKE NICE AND EASY
AND THEN
SOME SORT OF FIELD WHICH UPDATES DYNAMICALLY DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU'VE GOT HIGHLIGHTED
YEAH
THE FULL NAME AND THEN SPEAKERS
YEAH THAT SOUNDS GOOD
YEAH
YEAH
WE CAN DO ALL OF THAT WITHOUT EVEN EVER GOING ANYWHERE NEAR LOADING UP A
I THINK
I THINK
OH COOL
AND UH A THING
A MEETING A NOM
YEAH
YEAH
NOM
WHAT DOES NOM ACTUALLY STAND FOR
RIGHT
MM-HMM

YOU'VE GOT LOTS OF NOM SOMETHING AND THEN NITE SOMETHING AND THEN N. SOMETHING
OH YEAH
YEAH
AND N. X. T. SOMETHING AND
IT TELLS YOU WHAT
I THINK THE N. ONES ARE INTERFACES AND THE NITE ONE ONE OF THE WAYS ROUND ONE'S AN INTERFACE AND ONE'S ACTUALLY AN IMPLEMENTED CLASS
UH 'CAUSE YOU GO BACK ENOUGH AND THE UM THE WHAT'S ITS NAME IS NOT VERY GOOD
THE A. P. I. IS ALRIGHT BUT THERE'S NOT A LOT OF DESCRIPTION IN IT

OH WELL BASICALLY NOT NOT UNLESS YOU'VE GOT TIME FOR AT THE END
LIKE IF SOMEONE'S LOOKING FOR A PARTICULAR TERM
UM I DON'T KNOW IT JUST I JUST DON'T KNOW IF IT WOULD BRING US THAT MUCH
YEAH
JUST BECAUSE IF IT IS LIKE INDEPENDENTLY DOING THE WORDS FOR A PARTICULAR DOCUMENT IT'S NOT IT'S NOT REALLY GETTING THEM TOGETHER
WELL I D I KINDA THINK IT WOULD COMPLICATE THINGS QUITE A BIT AND NOT BRING US A LOT
I THINK IT WOULD
YEAH
I THINK I THINK IT W IT WOULD IT WOULD GIVE YOU THE MOST RELEVANT RESULT
HOW SO
UM OR IF IF THEY ARE TOGE I DON'T KNOW
IF IF IF THEY'RE LOOKING FOR LIKE I SAY SUNNY DAY AND
IT JUST DOESN'T YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THAT TERM AND RELEVANCE IS KIND OF IRRELEVANT BECAUSE IF THE TERM SHOWS UP IT SHOWS UP
YOU KNOW SUNNY SHOWS UP IN THIS DOCUMENT DAY SHOWS UP BUT THEY'RE NOT TOGETHER
AND THEN YOU'VE GOT THOSE THAT JUST MENTION YOU KNOW MENTION IT BRIEFLY LIKE ONCE OR TWICE SAYING
OR WOULD BE NICE ANYWAY
YOU KNOW MY LANGUAGE IS GERMAN OR SOMETHING STUPID THAT YOU DON'T REALLY WANT
SO YOU WANNA DISTINGUISH THOSE SOMEHOW
NO BUT FOR THINGS LIKE IF YOU SEARCH FOR LANGUAGE THEN YOU MIGHT HAVE YOU HAVE SOME TOPICS WHICH HAVE AS A
YOU KNOW N SOME SOME MEETINGS WHICH HAVE AS A TOPIC LANGUAGE THEY SPECIFICALLY SPEAK ABOUT LANGUAGE AND THEY USE THAT WORD LIKE IN EVERY SENTENCE
HMM
RIGHT
YEAH THAT WOULD HELP A LOT FOR THAT S FOR SINGLE TERMS IT WOULD BE VERY USEFUL
FOR MULTIPLE TERMS UNLESS YOU WANNA DO SOMETHING THERE WILL BE A WAY OF DOING IT FOR MULTIPLE TERMS
IN IN THAT SENSE FOR SINGLE FOR SINGLE WORD YEAH YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
WELL CREATE A NEW YEAH
I MEAN
UH FOR MULTIPLE TERMS WE CAN JUST DO SOMETHING REALLY SIMPLE
YEAH
OR YOU COULD PERHAP YOU COULD PENALIZE IT YOU COULD JUST PUT A B WEIGHT AGAINST IT
OR YOU COULD DO IT AND OVERRIDE IT BY THE YOU CA YOU COULD JUST IGNORE THE D RANKING IF IT DOESN'T SHOW UP TOGETHER
YEAH
YOU STILL HAVE TO DO THE N. X. T. SEARCH THEN RIGHT
YEAH
OH YEAH YEAH IT'LL YEAH YEAH
SO
WELL BUT YOU STILL HAVE TO DO THE SEARCH
IF IF IT DOESN'T SHOW UP
YEAH YEAH I KNOW
WELL IT WOULDN'T SHOW UP ON THE SEARCH RESULTS IF IT IF IT DIDN'T EXIST TOGETHER
SO IF YOU G HOW MANY PAIRS YOU GET YOU CAN
YEAH YOU DO THE N. X. T. SO SO IT DOESN'T SHOW UP TOGETHER
EITHER DISREGARD IT OR PUT A WEIGHTING AGAINST IT
YEAH
YEAH JUST JUST JUST DISREGARD IT YEAH

YEAH MIGHT HAVE TO TALK TO PERNILLA ABOUT THAT
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE ALL INTELLIGENT
WELL THAT'S SORTA WHAT IS YEAH THAT'S TRUE
YEAH
SOMETHING LIKE THAT WOULD JUST PUSH IT UP
'CAUSE SOME THINGS YOU'RE GONNA GET A LOT OF RESULTS FOR
AND IF THE ONE THAT YOU GOT JUST HAPPENED TO BE AT THE BOTTOM WHEN IT WAS ACTUALLY THE MOST RELEVANT ONE
YEAH EXACTLY
UM AND THEN WE COULD ACTUALLY PUT THAT LIKE ON THE LIST OF UM MEETINGS THAT R GET RETURNED

I DID HAVE A LOOK
IT'S GOOD THING
YEAH
'KAY
RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH
BUT UH I CAN DO THAT
THAT'S WELL RIGHT AFTER THIS YEAH
YEAH
I WAS MORE OR LESS JUST PLAYING WITH THE THINGS THAT HAD TO DO DIRECTLY WITH WHAT I WAS DOING
SO I DIDN'T DIDN'T TAKE IT FOR A FULL TEST DRIVE YET
OKAY
YEAH BE GOOD
IS THERE ANY ANY COMMENTS YOU HAVE ABOUT JUST LIKE WORDING AND OR SOME SORT OF MINOR THINGS
YEAH
I'LL DO IT
THE ONLY THE ONLY THING IS THE IT'S NOT THE START UP SCREEN IS NOT TOO PRETTY
BUT UH THE THE S IT DOESN'T MATTER TOO MUCH
NO LOOKED ALRIGHT
HMM
A LOT OF THIS JAVA STUFF ISN'T THOUGH
AT THE MOMENT AS WELL THE WHOLE WINDOWS THAT POP UP ARE NOT PRETTY AT ALL
SO I WILL IF
YEAH I KNOW
BUT UM YOU KNOW I WOULD MAKE THEM A BIT NICE IF I HAD MORE TIME BUT AT THE MOMENT IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THAT
MM-HMM
NO IT'S NOT IT'S NOT IT'S NOT A UM IT'S NOT THE TOP PRIORITY IS IT
IF YOU IF YOU CH IF YOU CHANGE YOUR WINDOW MANAGER IT MIGHT LOOK A LITTLE BIT NICER
OH YEAH
OKAY RIGHT
JUST YEAH
'CAUSE UM IT JAVA USES THE NATIVE WINDOWS DOESN'T IT
I THINK IT'D LOOK BETTER ON WINDOWS AS WELL ACTUALLY
SO
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
ACTUALLY CAN WE RUN IT ON WINDOWS
YEAH
BUT WE DON'T
HEY ZOE
NO
NASTY
SO I'M QUITE GLAD THAT IT LOOKS YOU KNOW NI NICE ON ONE OR THIS KIND OF THING
BUT THAT TOOK ME SO LONG TO DO THIS BLOODY START WINDOW
DO THEY
YEAH
OKAY
OH YEAH
WERE YOU USING LIKE A GUI BUILDER OR JUST ALL FROM CODE
NO THIS IS JUST YEAH
OKAY AND THAT'S
THAT'S NASTY
WELL THE UM THE UM SPEAKER CHARACTERISATION IS FINISHED
OKAY
WOW
OH YEAH
ALRIGHT
SO I DO IT IT'S FASTER FOR SOME BIZARRE REASON IF I LOG IN AT HOME AND THEN RUN THE CODE
I HAVEN'T DONE IT I HAVEN'T UPDATED ALL THOSE OBJECT FILES THOUGH 'CAUSE IT TAKES AGES ON THESE COMPUTERS
IT RUNS IT MUCH FASTER THAN IF I DO IT HERE
BUT
IT'S GOOD
THAT'S ODD YEAH
HMM
BUT THAT'S WHY I JUST CAN'T TO SIT IN THE LAB AND WAIT HALF AN HOUR OR WHATEVER IT TAKES
I'VE DONE STUFF LIKE THAT BEFORE IT'S INSANE IT'S INSANE
I DON'T KNOW
WELL WELL CAN YOU CAN YOU CONNECT TO YOUR HOME MACHINE FROM HERE AND THEN START IT FROM THERE
YEAH
JUST YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
IT'LL REALLY SPEED IT UP
NO I TRIED THAT BUT L YEAH
YEAH
YEAH I STARTED I STARTED USING YOUR UM UM THE SPEAK I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE SEEN THAT IN THE YEAH
TRY THAT A FEW TIMES
I SAW THAT YEAH
I SAW THAT IT IT DOE IT'S TELLS TELLS YOU WHAT SPEAKERS UH ARE IN WHICH MEETING AND THEN YOU CAN SEE WHICH TOPICS WHICH TOPICS YEAH
SOMETHING LIKE THAT YEAH
IT'S GOT A GOOD INTERFACE AND EASY TO USE
IT'S NICE
YEAH YEAH YEAH
BUT IT'S GOOD YOUR YOUR STUFF IS REALLY COO GOOD
BUT THERE'S SOME OF THEM SOME OF TH THE THING ACTUALLY WHAT I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT DIALOGUE ACTS WAS UM THERE ARE SOME THAT OCCUR ALL THE TIME THAT I JUST AND I DON'T KNOW HOW INTERESTING THERE ARE
YEAH
SO THE FIR ONE STATEMENT IS THAT IT WILL B I'D REMOVED IT 'CAUSE W IT WAS LIKE EVERYTHING IS PREFIXED BY STATEMENT
EVERY SINGLE DIALOGUE ACT STARTS WITH STATEMENT AND UM SO EVERYBODY'S TOP STATEMENT
THE UM TH THE DIALOGUE ACTS ARE ALL DONE AND THEY'RE QUITE AMUSING SOME OF THEM
SO IT
MM
RIGHT
RIGHT
WELL WOULDN'T WON'T WE INCLUDE THAT THEN
YEAH
WHO
AND THEN EVERYBODY THE NEXT ONE SEEMS TO MOSTLY BE BACK CHANNEL
WHO KNOWS WHAT BACK CHANNEL
SO I GOT RID OF THAT
WELL I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS
WHAT WAS IT
WHAT
IT'S WHEN THEY SAY MM UH-HUH YEAH
OH KEEP THAT THEN
UM AND THEN THE OTHERS ARE QUITE
IS THAT WHAT THAT MEANS
YEAH
OKAY
IT'S VERY
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S VERY USEFUL BECAUSE EVERYONE DOES IT
WELL IT'S KINDA BORING YEAH
EXACTLY
I KNOW
YEAH
SOME PEOPLE HAVE AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT IS A BIG ONE THAT COMES UP ALL THE TIME YES NO QUESTIONS
YEAH
ACTUALLY YEAH YOU CAN SEE THAT THEY DON'T DO THAT AND IT'S THE BOTTOM OF THEIR LIST
THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO DON'T DO THAT
SOME PEOPLE DON'T THOUGH
UM UH WHAT ELSE COMES UP
REALLY
HMM
THEY'RE ASLEEP I THINK
IT'S JUST VERY QUIET
RIGHT
SO WHICH YOU KNOW SUGGEST MAYBE YOU CAN SUGGEST A FEW THAT WHICH WHICH WOULD BE INTERESTING TO LIST
LIKE THREE OR FOUR OR SOMETHING
AND THEN EACH MEETING KNOWS ABOUT ALL THE DIFFERENT DIALOGUE ACTS FOR EACH PERSON IN THE MEETING AND THE AMOUNT THAT THAT OCCURRED
YOU GIVE IT ANY NUMBER AND IT WILL GIVE YOU THE TOP WHATEVER FOR EACH PERSON
BUT I CAN CHANGE THAT
THAT'S WHAT I M THAT'S WHAT I'M ASKING YOU REALLY
YEAH
UM SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE WANT TO DISPLAY
AND WILL GIVE YOU THAT IN TOP ORDER AS WELL OR WILL GIVE YOU OR YOU CAN JUST SEARCH FOR EACH SPECIFIC DIALOGUE ACT
DO YOU HAVE TO SEARCH ON IN B. S AND K. S RATHER THAN REAL WORDS RIGHT AT THE MOMENT
BUT THAT'S THE THING AND SO I WANTED TO KNOW WHETHER OR NOT WE 'CAUSE AT THE MOMENT YOU CAN GET THERE'S A METHOD THAT WILL JUST GIVE YOU THE TOP FIVE FOR OR THE TOP X.
MM-HMM
OH YEAH COOL
VERY NICE
MM-HMM
OR I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE LIKE UH A CHOICE SO THEY CAN FILTER THOSE OUT F THE THE TOP MOST COMMON
JUST SAY OKAY ALL SHOW ALL OR SHOW YOU KNOW ONLY THE IM INTERESTING ONES
OKAY RIGHT
ALL'S A LOT ALL'S LIKE TWENTY FIVE
YEAH
BUT
DIALOGUE ACTS PER B
I MEAN DO WE DO WE CARE IF YOU KNOW WHY NOT W I THINK YOU KNOW IT'D BE IT'D BE DIFFICULT
WELL IF WE JUST AUTOMATICALLY FILTER THESE OUT
YEAH
I DON'T KNOW YEAH IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER
BUT IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT IF YOU KNOW IF IN THE UM SPEAKER CHARACTERISATION WINDOW WE HAD A HEADING YOU KNOW TOP FIVE DIALOGUE ACTS
AND THEN THEN THE LITTLE BRACKETS BUT THEY'RE NOT ACTUALLY THE TOP FIVE BUT TOP FIVE MINUS THE MOST COMMON ONES WHICH ARE YOU KNOW
AND THEN IN THE MEETING YOU HAVE WHAT YOU COULD EITHER HAVE THE MOST COMMONLY OCCURRING ONES OR YOU COULD HAVE A LIST OF EACH SPEAKER'S TOP DIALOGUE ACTS
I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE THE GLOBAL TOP FIVE THAT CAUSE IT EACH SPEAKER'S GOT TOP A TOP WHATEVER
YEAH
AND SO JUST SAY ONE OF THE BOXES JUST EXPLAINS DOES THIS IS MY TOP FIVE DIALOGUE ACTS FOR THE SPEAKER
THEY'RE BORING
BECAUSE
YEAH
FOR THE SPEAKER
EITHER OF THOSE WOULD DO YOU
BUT IT WOULD START TAKE A LOT OF SPACE IF YOU HAVE IT
NO I WOULDN'T YEAH
OR YOU COULD HAVE NO YOU DON'T NEED THAT
AND THEN THEN THE TOP FIVE IN THAT MEET IN GLOBAL THE TOP FIVE THIS MEETING AND THEN THE REST IS R OBVIOUS ISN'T IT
SO YOU S 'CAUSE IT'S 'CAUSE IT'S A SPEAKER WINDOW THE SPEAKER CHARACTERISATION WINDOW COMES UP
SO YOU'VE GOT THE GLOBAL ONE THERE AND THEN HERE YOU CAN JUST HAVE THE TOP FIVE IN THIS MEETING
YEAH
EXACTLY YEAH
YEAH
YEP
MM
YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH
RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH JUST DO TOP FIVE BOTH LOCAL AND GLOBAL AND THEN HAVE ANOTHER
UM BUT THEN WE WANT A SELECTION OF THREE OR FOUR MAYBE INTERESTING ONES AND THEN
THAT OCCUR
YEAH
HE'S AN UNDERGRAD
HE'S THE JOKER
WELL THEY DO SOMETIMES BUT THEY'RE NOT THAT COMMON
ONE OF THEM IS JOKE
ONE GUY HAS TOP FIVE JOKE
YEAH IT'S INTERESTING ISN'T IT
BUT YOU TH SOME OFTEN THE INTERESTING ONES DON'T OCCUR THINGS LIKE JOKE DON'T OCCUR VERY OFTEN
THAT'S QUITE FUNNY
YEAH
OH
YOU FOLLOWED ALL THIS UP
AND SO YEAH WHO'S DOING WHAT
ACTUALLY YEAH
IT'S PERFECT
I MEAN THAT'S SORTA EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANNA DO AND LOOK AT THESE THINGS
OKAY
THIS IS GOOD FOR BROWSING THOUGH
YEAH
YEAH SEE AND THAT'S WHAT SPEAKER CHARACTERISATION GIVES YOU
EXACTLY
IT'S FUN
YEAH
IT'S LIKE I'M ONLY INTERESTED IN THIS GUY 'CAUSE HE SEEMS TO BE FUNNY
SO WHAT IS IT
WHO'S THE ONE WHO DR
YEAH EXACTLY
YEAH
THAT'D BE QUITE GOOD WOULDN'T IT
LET'S TAKE 'EM TO THE NEXT JOKE
RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
UM SO IS IS THIS PERCENTAGE THEN UM IF YOU SAY LIKE UM JOKE FOR THIS SPEAKER IS PERCENTAGE
I DON'T KNOW TWENTY IS THAT THE HO WHAT PERCENTAGE OF HIS SPEECH IS JOKE OR W HOW WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE JOKES
YEAH
WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE DIALOGUE ACTS THAT HE MAKES ARE JOKES IN THE MEETING AND GLOBALLY SEPARATELY SO ONCE GLOBALLY
YEAH
YEAH
ARE JOKES
YEAH
OKAY
UM I THINK MOST THINGS ARE CODED WITH A DIALOGUE ACT
A LOT OF THEM ARE CODED WITH Z. WHICH MEANS NO LABEL
'CAUSE THAT'S BORING
SO I JUST IGNORED THAT AS WELL
YEAH
SO YEAH YOU HAVE TO BE ORIGINAL ABOUT YOUR MATERIAL
AND STATEMENT WHICH IS BORING
OTHERWISE WE DON'T CREDIT IT TO YOU
SO THEY PUT THEY PUT THE THE DIALOGUE ACT AND THEN THEY PUT A DOUBLE A COLON AND THEY PUT THAT ASIDE
JUST IGNORED ANYTH ANY QUOTED MATERIAL 'CAUSE IT'S GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH I JUST SCRAPPED IT
YEAH YEAH YEAH SOMEBODY ELSE'S JOKE
AND ALSO THE OTHER THING THAT THEY HAVE IS UM IF SOMEBODY QUOTES SOMETHING SO IF I QUOTE A JOKE TO YOU THEY SEPARATE THAT
HMM
YEAH
RIGHT OKAY
WELL IT'S NOT A REAL JOKE ANYWAYS
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH I MEAN JUST KEEP IT SIMPLE AS

ARE WE GONNA BE UH TRYING TO GET THE OUTPUT FROM THAT AND I DON'T KNOW STILL HAVEN'T FOUND OUT IF IT'S UM
FEASIBLE TO OPEN UP MORE THAN ONE WELL
SO
LIKE TO BE LOOKING THROUGH THE HIGHEST RANKED ONES FIRST
SO IF WE ARE GONNA LOOK THROUGH ONLY FIVE OF THEM
AS MANY MM NOM OBJECTS AS WE CAN FOR EACH MEETING TO DO LIKE WE WERE GONNA NEED LIKE FIGURE THAT THE RANKING DID MAKE SENSE
JUST PICK THE TOP FIVE TO TO DO THE THE SEARCH AND SINCE THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR ANYWAYS
YEAH WE'LL THINK ABOUT THAT
MM-HMM
I CAN SEND YOU RIGHT NOW

OH RIGHT
LIKE LENGTH OR
DID HE SAY ANYTHING ABOUT LIKE H WHAT HE EXPECTS OF THE FINAL REPORT AND STUFF
NO
BUT YEAH
UM JUST MADE SOME COMMENTS THE LAST MEETING
UM THERE ARE A F A FEW LITTLE THINGS
JUST GENERAL LIKE HOW IT ALL INTEGRATES BLAH BLAH BLAH ALL THIS KIND OF STUFF
DO WE KNOW DID HE EVER SAY HOW LONG IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
ONLY
NO
I'D EXPECT SOMEWHERE TEN TO FIFTEEN PAGES
MM IT'S GONNA BE A LOT
I MEAN HOW LONG WE'RE THIS
I THINK
ALTHOUGH IT'S FIFTY PERCENT OF THE MARK I THINK IS IT
ONE TWO
BUT WE CAN WRITE A LOT
I MEAN I THINK WE SHOULD WE SHOULD WRITE EVERYTHING
YEAH
WELL WE HAVE A BIT OF TIME TO DO THE WRITING UP
EXACTLY
YEAH
'CAUSE THIS I MEAN WE HAVE INTERIM REPORT OF SEVEN PAGES AND THAT'S WE CAN Y YEAH
WE COULD P PROBABLY JUST EXPAND THAT
SO THAT'LL BE GOOD
SEVEN PAGES
OH
I MEAN 'CAUSE IT I MEAN A LOT OF IT'S GONNA BE THE SAME THING
YEAH
JUST A FINE TUNED OR DETAILED AND YEAH
TRUE
BUT
YEAH
AND THEN I MEAN WRITE ABOUT THE EVALA EVALUATION AND STUFF
THAT'S GONNA BE QUITE A FEW PAGES
MORE STUFF
YEAH WE CAN N
YEAH THAT COULD BE YEAH THAT COULD EASILY BE FIVE OR SIX PAGES
SO I DON'T THINK
YEAH SHOULD BE GOOD
PAGE IS GONNA BE PROBLEM
OKAY
BUT UH
THAT'D BE GOOD
SO DO YOU WANNA WRITE HIM AN EMAIL THEN
SURE
UM
AND UH WHEN I GET HOME TODAY WHICH WILL BE BEFORE
UM
BEFORE HALF PAST SIX I WILL MAKE THAT FILE READABLE WRITABLE EVERYTHING
OH YEAH SURE
YEAH NO NO BIG RUSH
WELL I I WILL
UH UH
ALTHOUGH JUST TO GET IT OUT OF THE WAY
SO I'LL TRY AND REMEMBER TO DO THAT TO MY OWN S
WELL I WILL I WILL NEED YOUR SNIPPETS OF CODE OR IT'D BE GOOD IF I HAD THEM BY TOMORROW EVENING
YEAH
YEAH
YEP
OH I WAS GONNA ASK UM
AT THE MOMENT YOUR SEARCH WINDOW
HOW IS IT ORGANISED
JUST UM SORTA LIKE GOOGLE TYPE THING AND JUST UM OH
JUST BASIC UM PRETTY MUCH LIKE THE INTERIM DO YOU WANNA DO YOU HAVE THE INTERIM STUFF
IS IT IS IT JUST IS IT STILL DIVIDED INTO TWO AND THE BOTTOM HALF IS JUST JUST EMPTY
OKAY
BUT AT THE BEGINNING IT WHEN YOU HAVEN'T SEARCHED YET
YEAH
YEAH
THEN AS THESE COME UP IT'LL JUST POP 'EM IN THERE
AND THEN IF YOU I DON'T KNOW DOUBLE CLICK ON ONE
I MEAN HOW TO GET THAT THAT COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF WINDOWS
IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING YET
S LIKE THAT'S THAT'S THE OTHER BIG PART
OKAY
YEAH
UM
UM THAT WAS WHY IT WAS SORTA DECIDING TO GET THE THREE PANES IN THERE INSTEAD OF JUST THE ONE
BECAUSE THE THING IS IF WE HAVE DIFFERENT THINGS IN HERE LIKE TRANSCRIPTS VERSUS SUMMARIES VERSUS TOPICS
YEAH YEAH YEAH
HMM
YEAH M M. MAKES MORE SENSE
YEAH SO SO THERE'S A COUPLE OF THOSE LITTLE THINGS AS WE YEAH EXACT IT'S BEAUTIFUL
WELL Y Y THIS THIS IS THE ICON BY THE WAY
HMM
UM YEAH MAYBE YOU WANNA DO UM LEFT HANDED UM YEAH ONE LEFT CLICK UM HIGHLIGHTS THE THE RESULT IN WHATEVER YOU'VE GOT OPEN
OKAY
IN LIKE THE OTHER WINDOWS LIKE THE VARIOUS LIKE UM IF WE'RE IN THE TOPIC
OR
IS THAT HOW IT WORKS IN THE OTHER ONES
WHICH OTHER ONES
USUALLY ONE LEFT CLICK IT'S HIGHLIGHTS IT CROSS HIGHLIGHTS EVERYTHING I THINK
YEAH
UM YEAH
SO IF IT'S LIKE THE TOPIC WINDOW OR THE WHATEVER
IF YOU HAVE LIKE A PARTICULAR W WINDOW THAT YOU WANT ME TO MIMIC ITS BEHAVIOUR
THEN LIKE JUST FIND IT IN THE PROGRAMME AND JUST SAY OKAY JUST HOW THIS ONE DOES IT
MM WELL IT'S DIFFICULT BECAUSE
SO
SO THEN I CAN JUST SORTA TRACE BACK AND FIGURE OUT WHAT OBJECTS THEY ARE AND BRING 'EM INTO HERE
WELL YOU COULD LOOK UP
MM NO THAT'S DIFFICULT
BECAUSE IT THE TRANSCRIPTION WINDOW DOES CROSS HIGHLIGHTING
THAT WAS THAT WAS A PAIN
IN A VERY AWKWARD WAY BECAUSE IT HAS TO FIND THE TOPIC FIRST
HMM
OKAY
AND UM WHEN YOU WHEN YOU G UM RIGHT CLICK ON A TOPIC IT POPS OPEN THE LIST OF MEETINGS THAT CONTAIN THAT POP PO TOPIC
AND UM AND THAT WORKS WHEN YOU WHEN YOU LEFT DOUBLE CLICK ON A TOPIC OH ON A MEETING SORRY THEN IT LOADS IT
OKAY
SO YOU COULD
YOU COULD TAKE THAT FOR LOADING
RIGHT
SO IF WE HAVE THAT UM THE SAME ON THIS ONE AT LEAST THAT YOU IF YOU DOUBLE LEFT LICK THEN IT LOADS
OKAY
MM
MM
SO ONE LEFT CLICK JUST HIGHLIGHTS IS THAT
HIGHLIGHTS UM YEAH
I MEAN A HI OBVIOUSLY HIGHLIGHTS WHATEVER YOU'VE CLICKED ON HERE BUT ALSO HIGHLIGHTS UM
OH JUST THE ITEM IN
THE TRANSCRIPT OR WHATEVER IT IS
ACTUALLY IT'S DIFFICULT BECAUSE
THE
CAN I HAVE IT
IF EVEN IF WE COULD JUST
BECAUSE YOU N YOU DON'T YOU ONLY EVER HAVE ONE MEETING OPEN AND THOSE RESULTS WILL BE OP I WELL I SUPPOSE IF YOU HAVE A IF YOU HAVE A LOCAL SEARCH
THEN IT COULD CROSS HIGHLIGHT
WELL THE ONE MEETING
YEAH
THAT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE
BECAUSE YOU KNOW IF YOU GET BACK SEVERAL DIFFERENT MEETINGS HERE AND YOU'VE ONLY GOT ONE MEETING OPEN THEN YOU CAN'T CROSS OUT ANYTHING
RIGHT
OH YEAH
TO ACTUALLY LOOK FOR THE TERMS WE'RE NOT LOADING IT ON A VAL OF SEVENTY SIX I MEAN OR SEVENTY FIVE WHATEVER IT IS
SO IT IT WILL BE A BIT DIFFERENT FROM FROM HOW THAT IS RIGHT NOW WHEN WHEN WE DO THE GLOBAL SEARCH AT LEAST
CHOOSE THE ONE WE WANNA ACTUALLY DO THIS WI I THINK MULTI SELECT WOULD MAKE THE MOST SENSE
UM SO THE R THE RESULTS FROM THAT WILL YOU KNOW NARROW DOWN WHAT WE'RE GONNA USE FOR THE LOCAL SEARCH
AND IF WE CAN YEAH
THEN WE ARE GONNA DO IT LIKE HOW WE SAID BEFORE AND POP UP A LIST OF THE VARIOUS MEETINGS THAT FOUND THOSE TERMS
AND THEN WE'LL EITHER YOU KNOW MULTI SELECT OR YOU KNOW
LIKE IF WE'RE DOING A GLOBAL SEARCH
YEP
WELL JUST UM IF THERE'S LIKE THREE OF THE TOP MEETINGS LIKE LIKE WE SAID BEFORE
LANGUAGE WE'RE LOOKING FOR THE L WORD LANGUAGE AND GET THE HIGHEST RATED ONES
THEN WE'LL JUST DO THE LOCAL SEARCH ON THOSE ONES THAT ARE CHOSEN
ALTHOUGH YEAH THIS THIS WILL UH THIS IS ACTUALLY DIFFERENT FROM HOW WE PRINT IT UP HERE
OKAY
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY MULTI SELECT
MM-HMM
OH OKAY
OH I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN YEAH
OKAY
IF NOT IT CAN'T
SO
WELL I I I IN ANY CASE IF YOU LEFT CLICK ON ON A RESULT THAT IS CONTAINED IN THE MEETING THAT IS CURRENTLY OPEN THEN IT SHOULD CROSS HIGHLIGHT
EXACTLY YEP
YES YES
OKAY
UM IT SHOULD BE FAIRLY SIMPLE TO JUST GET THE TOPICS AND THE SUMMARIES FRO USING THAT TEXT EXTRACTOR THINGY YOU WROTE RAY
YEAH YOU HAVE TO START AGAIN
UH YEAH
IT'S JUST DO TOPICS INSTEAD OF SEG YEAH YOU HAVE TO GET THE TOPICS OUT INSTEAD OF THE SEGMENTS
YOU JUST LIKE OR
YEAH
EXCUSE ME
I JUST REALISED I HAVEN'T DONE THAT PART YET
HMM
CAN YOU MAKE
IS IT D VERY DIFFICULT TO MAKE ANOTHER ANOTHER GUI BUT ONLY FOR A GLOBAL SEARCH
UM SO THAT WE SEARCH TWO DIFFERENT
BECAUSE UM HMM
JUST JUST TAKE THAT AWAY THE THE LOCAL CHECK BOX
RIGHT
YEAH
THAT'S ACTUALLY FAIRLY
OH
UH-HUH
TO HAVE FOR THE START UP
TO HAVE FOR THE START UP
YEAH BECAUSE IN THE START UP SCREEN YOU CAN'T HAVE A
THAT'S THAT'S QUITE T STRAIGHT FORWARD
YOU KNOW LOCAL ANYWAYS YEAH
SURE YEP
NO THAT'S EASY
THAT'D BE REALLY HANDY
YEAH WOULD YOU MAKE THAT
IN FACT YOU CAN JUST LEAVE EVERYTHING AS IT IS AND JUST REMOVE THE CHECK BOX
EVERYTHING ELSE CAN JUST STAY THE SAME YOU KNOW
YEAH
MM-HMM
RADIO BUTTON
YEAH
TO YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO DO A GLOBAL SEARCH FOR TOPICS
YEAH G UH THAT WAS LI LIKE YEAH IF I'LL MAKE A JUST INDEX
YEAH YEAH
YEAH I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D BOTHER WITH THAT BUT YEAH COOL
BUT YEAH
YEAH
YEAH IT DOES ISN'T IT
YEAH
I DIDN'T THINK WE'RE GONNA BOTHER WITH THAT
IS THAT WHAT YOU MEAN YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
EXACTLY
YEAH
WHAT
WELL IT IT KINDA MAKES SENSE
IT WOULD BE KINDA COOL
BUT UH
WELL I I MEAN I I'M F IT'S NOT FIRST PRIORITY MAYBE BUT DON'T KNOW
ACTUALLY ARE WE BOTHERING WITH OUR TOPIC STUFF STILL
WE ARE STILL DOING OUR TOPIC SEGMENT
WELL YOU ARE YOU ARE I GUESS
LIKE SINCE WE CAN'T DO THE LABELLING AND ALL THE REST
OR IS THAT SORTA GONE LIKE OUR OWN TOPIC SEGMENT
YEAH
WITH
WHAT
WELL WE'LL CERTAINLY DO IT ENOUGH TO MAKE IT SO WE CAN DO SOME NUMERICAL ANALYSIS ON THE YEAH BUT AT AT THE VERY LEAST
OKAY
OKAY
PROBABLY
MM
BUT WE'RE NOT GONNA BE WE WON'T BE L DOING A GLOBAL SEARCH ON THE TOPICS FOR OUR TOPICS SINCE THEY DON'T HAVE LABELS
I DON'T KNOW
YEAH ALL THE LABEL TWOS YEAH
LA LABEL ALL THE LABEL ONES I'LL OPEN 'EM
OKAY
MM
WELL YEAH EVEN IF EVEN IF I HAPPEN TO MANAGE TO MAKE IT DECENT KEYWORDS
NO WE WON'T BE DOING THAT
SO
UH YEAH
NO
EXACTLY
YEAH
I DON'T THINK WE CAN EXPECT YOU TO ALSO COME UP WITH THE SEARCH THING FOR IT AS WELL
YEAH
LIKE IF YOU'RE CREATING IF YOU'RE CREATING X. M. L. FILES OF THIS
YEAH OKAY
WELL NO IT WILL BE KIND OF STRAIGHT FORWARD
YEAH OKAY
UM I DID HAVE A LOOK AT TRYING TO CREATE X. M. L. FILES
BUT IF I COLLATE YEAH
I SUPPOSE IT'S NOT IT'S IT'S AS STRAIGHTFORWARD AS WRITING IN X. M. L. FILES
BUT IT'S BUT IT'S ORGANISING THE SEGMENT DATA THOUGH
IT WOULD JUST LOOKS SO COMPLICATED TO GET IT FROM
WOULD YEAH
YEAH IF I CREATE X. M. L. FILES BUT IF I M I'M NOT GONNA DO THAT
IT DID LOOK LIKE A QUITE A A MISSION REALLY
YEAH
THE UM FROM A PLAIN TEXT FILE BACK INTO ORGANISE IT BY WHO WHICH SPEAKER SPEAKS WHAT AND HOW N DOING THE SEGMENT I THINK THAT WAS THE STUPIDEST WAY THEY COULD EVER HAVE ORGANISED THE WHOLE THING IF YOU ASK ME
BUT
BUT ORGANISE IT BY TIME NOT BY SPEAKER
BUT YEAH
YEAH
HMM
HMM
SO I DON'T KNOW REALLY WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO ABOUT THAT
OKAY
YEAH
I GUESS WE JUST
YEAH
ARE WE DONE
